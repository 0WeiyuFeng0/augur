Subject: [Advisors] GlusterFS Life Cycle
Message-ID: <50A5FA9A.1050806@joejulian.name>

There's been a number of questions, lately, about the life cycle of a 
GlusterFS version. Since I've not seen anything definite from anybody 
yet, I've started the ball rolling on this. Please consider this and 
discuss it on the Discussion tab.
