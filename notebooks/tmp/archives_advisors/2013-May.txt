Hi there,

I'm going to keep the advisors@ list going, because I can think of many cases where we will need a sounding board for community things. 

A few of you expressed interest in joining the Community Board, and I included you in the email that I just sent below. If you did *not* receive the email below and wish to be included in the new board, please let me know ASAP. 

However, please note that in the new board, we cannot have multiple representatives from the same company, although we're making an exception for AB. Also note that on the new board, you will be delegated with tasks and expected to contribute to the greater community in some material way. Or you can just stay on the advisors list and not have any of that responsibility :)

Thanks,
JM

Subject: Gluster Community Board - save the date: June 11 in Boston

Note: things discussed in this email are confidential. Please respect our desire to release this information on schedule, which I'll provide in detail below.

Greetings,

I wanted to reach out to each of you as the charter members of the Gluster Community Board. We currently have 7 organizations who have signed the letter of intent to join the Gluster Commumnity:

- Intel
- Red Hat
- Open Source Lab at Oregon State
- Linux Foundation
- DataLab
- HortonWorks
- Harvard University

There's also one more company that should sign this week, but I wanted to get started and open up the conversation.

In addition to the companies mentioned above, there will also be 3 - 5 individuals representing the greater community's interests. Note that the number of board members has no hard limit, and we can vote on future additions.

When I started putting together the governance model and business plan a few months ago, I never dreamed that we would pull together such an amazing group of technology leaders. We are going to surprise a whole lot of people when we announce.

Speaking of announcing, here's the schedule:

- 5/29 - General press release announcing new community charter members and new board. Expect an email this week from our press people for quotes from each of you. 

- 6/11 - first board meeting - at Red Hat Summit in Boston. This is where we will discuss board officer selection, a marketing fund and committee, voting criteria, and some other things that will be on the agenda. For this first iteration, expect to meet for 2 hours. For those who can't make it to Boston, we'll set up a conference call.

- 7/23 - OSCON party - would love to make this the coming-out party for the Gluster Community


Other discussion points:

- Partner workshops - we have a tentative schedule in place for the rest of the year. Would be good to get input on who can host and participate.

- Gluster software distribution - Because we now have more than one project, we will have a distribution consisting of multiple pieces. One of the things the board will determine is how and when a project graduates to be in the official GSD releases. This may require a technical steering committee, which is something we can determine at the inaugural board meeting

- As a side note, we are also having a workshop + hackfest in Boston on June 14. If you're interested in participating, please let me know.


It's taken a lot of work to get here, but it's been very exciting. I look forward to working with all of you. I will set up a mailing list for board at gluster.org, but I wanted each of you to know who else is participating. Look for a mailing list invite soon, and then we can kick off board member introductions.


Thanks!
John Mark Walker
Gluster Community Lead

I just realized that I never responded to this. Taking care of that now.

Because we seem to be fairly unique. On one hand, we have a flagship project much like Eclipse, but on the other hand, I don't like how Eclipse mandates one specific license. As a result, I don't think Eclipse ever matured beyond the "we're a Java IDE" stage.

Apache just seems to have too much overhead for my taste, but I admit to being biased there.

oVirt did some good things and is probably the closest analog to what we're doing. However, they didn't mandate that its members actually make contributions and they didn't put in a clause where board members could be removed if they didn't fulfill their obligations, which is what we've done.

Yup.

There are a couple of different things here.

- Organizations can join the Gluster community as contributing members, if they sign the LOI.

This is separate from

- Anyone can contribute a project to the Gluster Community. These projects will have to reach milestones before bringing a vote for graduation. The voting will be handled by the community board. Once reaching graduation, they can be included in the official Gluster Software Distribution. Right now, there are two projects in the GSD: GlusterFS and Gluster-Swift.

Legally speaking, Red Hat owns the Gluster copyrights and trademarks. However, because I want this to eventually be a foundation, I will run the board functionally as a foundation. Right now, that's the best we can do.

That will be voted on at the first board meeting.

See above re: trademarks and copyrights. Each project will be run individually by the engineers who work on it in a "whoever contributes code guides the projects". The Gluster board will function independently and govern the community process. 


> Assuming the answer to this is 'no'. What is the relationship to Red Hat,

Right now, Red Hat controls the chairperson position in the form of "me". My hope is that we'll get to the point where we'll get so much momentum that Red Hat will be forced to push into a full-blown foundation, either joining another or forming its own. 

Legally speaking, if Red Hat wanted to pull the plug and be the heavy, they could. But our goal is entirely opposite of that, and our strategy is that in order for us to be successful, we have to build long-lasting partnerships with community members. That means giving up control in return for a better software base and a more active community. I know itt's not the definitely answer you're looking for, but it basically amounts to "trust us."

For determining the direction of Gluster.org and the Gluster community, the board holds the authority. I've managed this very carefully so that we don't get executives trying to push their viewpoints on the community. 

Finally, some of you work for certain companies that I hope will join the Gluster Community as official members. It's too late now to join as a charter member, but becoming a member will be good for everyone.

Thanks!
JM

Just a FYI: Creating a new foundation from scratch is *incredibly*
difficult, esp if the desire is a 501(c)3. A 501(c)6 is easier,
but by being a "trade-group", the focus is, of course, on

Yes, that's probably the least desirable route, as far as I can tell. I think OpenStack went that direction because of a loss of faith in the sponsoring organization.

That is the intent here. The Gluster Community Board will not meddle in the technical operations of the project, except to determine if they reach the criteria for graduation.

Yes, Red Hat assumes the legal risk. 

As for business interests, it's pretty well-known inside Red Hat that the success of the Gluster community is absolutely essential to the success of Red Hat Storage.

Having gone through the process at attempting to form some manner of foundation twice with Fedora, I have to agree - I don't think the idea of spinning off to a separate foundation has legs, and speaking frankly. With groups like the ASF, TLF, Eclipse, SPI, Outercurve, etc. I have to wonder at the wisdom of even trying, running the org becomes a distraction to actually getting things done in the project(s). Yes, no existing group will be perfect (and neither will anything you create), but pick one that has a governance that you can live with if you really need to be independent.
