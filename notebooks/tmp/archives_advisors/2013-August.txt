Gluster Developer Community Surges by Nearly 300 Percent, Ships GlusterFS 3.4 Open Software-defined Storage Distribution 


August 6, 2013 

by The Red Hat Storage Team 
Congratulations to the Gluster Community! In addition to shipping GlusterFS 3.4, the latest release of the open source, scale-out storage system, the Gluster Community has significantly increased its number of projects and contributing developers in just three short months. Since May 2013, the Gluster Community has grown from seven projects for the GlusterFS distribution to more than 30 incubating open software-defined storage projects for big data, demonstrating nearly 300 percent growth in the number of developers. 

As an open source community, the Gluster Community was created to drive open software-defined storage. The growth was enabled in part by recent important developments in the Gluster Community, including the introduction of Gluster Community Forge and the formation of The Gluster Community Board that includes eight leading organizations and technology providers in the storage and big data markets. The Gluster Community Forge is a collaborative development web site where like-minded developers and organizations can incubate, develop and collaborate on new open software-defined storage projects. The Gluster Community Forge also helps developers in individual projects independently manage their roadmaps, development, and implementation. 

Now available for download, GlusterFS 3.4 offers KVM/QEMU integration, higher performance, and cloud enhancements to provide high reliability, scalability, and data mobility to enterprise users and application developers worldwide. 

For virtualization, GlusterFS 3.4 features include QEMU integration with libgfapi, a new Block Device translator, and general performance enhancements for VM image storage for KVM. A new virtualization management user interface, oVirt 3.2, is available with its RESTful API gateway for integration with additional management tools. 

For security, GlusterFS 3.4 now supports Server Quorum, SSL encryption, and a multi-threaded Glusterd that also added operating version support. Quorum enables split-brain prevention and resolution for replicated volumes. Security features include support for SSL-based encryption of ?in-flight? data, and NFSv3 ACLs, WORM (write once, read many) volume types. The multi-threaded Glusterd allows for better scaling and higher performance, and operating version support for Glusterd enables easier, rolling upgrades and using multiple versions of GlusterFS. 

The Gluster Community also recently announced that GlusterFS is OpenStack-ready. This is primarily due to the work started in 2012 with the OpenStack community focused on how OpenStack cloud developers and operators can use GlusterFS to support the three primary OpenStack storage modes. Instructions for using GlusterFS with OpenStack are now documented for the native OpenStack storage interfaces Swift, Cinder, and Glance. This allows OpenStack application developers and service providers to gain the benefits of Gluster?s scale-out storage software. 

Its an exciting time for the Gluster Community. Again, kudos to the Gluster Community for shipping GlusterFS 3.4 while it greatly expands its project scope, allowing participants to continue to drive open source sofware-defined storage innovation.

I cannot agree more. I have been advocating to dual-license or re-license
GlusterFS under Apache Software License v2 for the last two years. GPL
defends freedom strongly, but hurts adoption. Folks at Red Hat care about
software freedom more than adoption. Lets push it once again.

Personally, I see dual-licensing as being better, but not ideal. It
still leaves a lot of confusion on the part of the non-FOSS-zealots.
I'd personally advocate for a single permissive license.

Yes, ideally. How ever, linking to older GPLv2 code may be problematic with
Apache License. QEMU is GPLv2.

Of the reasons against, this is the one that gives me pause. Our signature feature that went into 3.4 was the QEMU integration. We cannot, under any circumstance, do anything to jeopardize that collaboration. I'm not entirely sure what the consequences are of linking Apache-licensed code to GPLv2 libraries. I can ask for a report on that and present the results here. 

Otherwise, I'm generally in favor of the move. I used to be a huge fan of copyleft, but over the years I've seen that community governance and development process seem to mean a whole lot more than which license a project chooses. 

I'd be very curious if anyone here strongly disagrees with a move to the Apache License 2.0, the QEMU integration issue notwithstanding.

One other thought - if we have to dual-license to get around this, I can get on board with that, but my preference is to use a single license.

No sense in making a move to permissive licensing unless there's a
plan to go with it.

If you can identify big industry partners who would work with Gluster
but do not because of the GPL, then I think it would be time to build
a plan to move away from it.  Can you identify any such partners?

You don't want to go through the hassle of a move until you have
identified concrete benefits, I don't think.  And you obviously have a
big issue to sort re: QEMU integration regardless.

But generally, there's nothing inherently superior about GPL, and many
drawbacks, and all things being equal, I think permissive is probably
superior.  Even the dual-licensing tactic is suspect; you can get the
same ability to create differentiated product offerings with
permissive licenses, without the headaches of copyright
assignment/licensing. The one unique benefit you *do* get from
dual-licensing is proprietary redistribution lock-in -- and this may
be a useful tactic down the road. You need ubiquity first. This was so
successful for MySQL because of the sheer number of people using
MySQL, and the fundamental suitability of a slightly-modified database
as an embedded piece of other products.  I don't think Gluster has
those same advantages.

This.

There needs to be a plan around it. There needs to be a real
justification; ignoring my experience, and even our preferences -
what's the project justification for such a painful change. Change for
change's sake is awful.
JMW is probably closer to this than most - but are there people who
have objected to using gluster on the license grounds? Objected to
contributing to gluster because of licensing? Perhaps a good place to
look is deals where a competitor to Gluster has been chosen.

I don't have much experience in this realm but from what I know its a big
deal and can be disastrous if done incorrectly. I agree with David's
statement above, there needs to be a solid reason for the move, a plan and
community support behind it.

For those of you who wish to participate in the release process of GlusterFS (or you know someone who does), the GlusterFS core team has set a deadline of this Thursday, August 14, for proposing new features in this release cycle. 

This will be the first release included in the Gluster Software Distribution (which will be a discussion topic at the next board meeting). 

Please see the links at the bottom of this email and send any questions to gluster-devel.

Thanks,
JM

For obvious reasons, the proprietors of the site criticized in that post are none too happy.

Do we...

3. take editorial license and change some of the more inflammatory verbiage

Is Dice a Gluster customer?  A Red Hat customer?  Likely to become either?

If so, I would vote for #3, with a note that some of the language has
been toned down from the original.  Or possibly #2 with a more
detailed disclaimer.

If not, I would vote for #2 straight up.  Dice has no reason to expect
the broader open source community to be happy with this change in SF
policy.

I assume you're referring to the argument against the word "malware" at 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6262347

I agree with Justin. Installing something unintended that alters the 
behavior or performance of someone's computer is malicious. Even a 
seemingly benign google toolbar is still one strip of screen taken up 
that would have otherwise been usable.

The argument against the use of the word "malware" also assumes that the 
"mal" is "malicious". The prefix "mal" comes from the french word and 
indicates "illness" or "affliction" which most certainly matches with 
the regard for these pieces of software.

The post itself seems to reflect the attitude and mores of the community 
that I've met and suggests that we believe in preserving trust and 
acting with integrity.

I also find it interesting that the most vocal opponent to the post is 
someone who's profiting from the malware.

My opinion is to leave it up as-is.

#2 IMO

I'd even consider going so far as to do #4 which is #2 plus updates about their attempts to silence you and introduce them to the Streisand effect.

See this post: http://www.gluster.org/2013/08/how-far-the-once-mighty-sourceforge-has-fallen/

For obvious reasons, the proprietors of the site criticized in that post are none too happy.

Do we...

1. take it down
2. leave it up, with the entire post, including the disclaimer, intact
3. take editorial license and change some of the more inflammatory verbiage

Of those three only option 2 seems reasonable.  However I also suggest that
we add such a "disclaimer" not only to some posts, but to the whole blog
section -- a common footer or sidebar visible on all blog pages.

It should be made clear on every page of the blog section that the posts
are published by individual authors and do not necessarily represent anyone
else's views.  Along with that each post should have a signature with the
authors preferred method of being contacted.  This seems like the best way
to deflect such requests from being addressed to the blog administrator.

John Mark, would you care to share what you received?  Just curious though,
it probably wouldn't change my opinion any.

best,

Greetings,

If any of you would like to present at the above-referenced event on a topic related to open software-defined storage (does not necessarily need to be about GlusterFS), send a note to cfp (at) gluster.org. I still have one or two slots available, depending on length.

Thanks,
JM
