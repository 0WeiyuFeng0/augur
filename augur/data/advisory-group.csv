Sorry I disappeared so quickly yesterday but I was about to get to the airport and the hotspot just broke down? Anyhow?
Just a short question: Could I show you a couple of slides of what we are doing right now with ODL and where we found shortcomings in the whole process? I think it would be a good point to start when discussing possible new actions.

Best,

The TSC is asking for any suggestions we may have regarding the graduation review of a project that would indicate a project is ?mature?; please see the thread below.

Note that the TSC indicates that the meaning of ?mature? is already defined (see link below). We?re not being asked to debate the semantic use of the word, rather the state a project must be in to qualify as a ?fully functioning, successful open source project.?

This is our first formal such request; I suggest we discuss on-list and at the end of the week I?ll see if we have any conclusions to summarize.

Cheers,
Chris.

The really succinct, statement is we're trying to to come to an agreement about what the TSC should bear in mind and ask for as collateral when we start holding graduation reviews to move projects to mature. Note that graduation reviews and mature are technical terms defined in the project lifecycle document here:
https://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases
This thread should serve as good, if lengthy, background on what that question including differing opinions on what can be (and should be) in scope for the review under our current governing documents as well as what we might like to see if we were willing to change our governing documents. Any input from the Advisory Group on either or both of those would be interesting and much appreciated.

Cheers,
--Colin

Could I ask for a succinct statement of the query and its background? To make sure we answer the right question :)

I'll save my own detailed?comments for later, save that as Neela suggests the word 'mature' has much implied meaning for end users?around fitness for purpose derived in no small part?from having mileage under its belt (preferably miles that were honest about their?emissions too).?

TSC members, developers.? 

Can I suggest that you ask our Advisory Group members what they would expect as users from a Mature project? This is exactly the type of question we shouldn't be guessing as to what end users want and expect but getting real input and data. Mature is inherently a label who's primary use is to convey a certain level of expectations for an end-users. We should make sure that whatever process we ask a project to follow to measure whether they get this label fits as well as we can with what an end-user would assume such a label means (My 7 year old definitely thinks he exhibits a high level of maturity, and based on his own definition of maturity he probably does. Unfortunately for him it doesn't so much matter whether he meets his own definition of mature but whether he meets ours). Phil and Todd can facilitate formulating the questions, and/or creating a forum for discussion.?

That's not what I had in mind, which makes me think I'm misunderstanding
something. I wasn't around when this was written, so that seems likely.

Sticking with the security example, I'm proposing we make use of the

History of Releases -> Release Review -> Security Issues

chain to consider ""opinions about the contents of [the] 'Security Issues'
section"" during Graduation Reviews.

Sure... I would find it pretty reasonable to follow the links to the Release Reviews
and look at their Security Issues sections.? That's just taking a look at the supporting collateral
backing the claim for having followed the Mature Release process.
?

Coming back to what I may be misunderstanding...

Is ""Maturity"" here just about following the process, creating the right
wikis at the right times and such? A project with a Release Review that
says all the most horrible things (late, introduced malware, whatever)
can be ""Mature"", as long as they follow the process? Or am I missing
a step that would block such projects from reaching ""Mature""?

Yeah, that is an interesting question.? Part of the intention as I remember it originally
was to have Mature be mostly mechanical and not political (thus its requirements are
mostly mechanical, and not political), and to try to have it be stuff that would be?
pretty obviously true or false after the fact (example: Working code base.? Definitely
tricky to lay out a precise set of ticky boxes for without having a code base in front of you,
but not all that hard to determine about a code base you are looking at).

Late is an interesting question, because the Mature Release process is *not* the Simultaneous Release
process... its most definitely simpler.? For example, the TSC *can* (and does, often for reasons I whole?
heartedly endorse) layer on quite a bit more structure than the Mature Release Process does.
As written, the Mature Release Process is mostly about ""Did you let folks know what you thought you thought you were
doing so there was some hope of non-insider engaging"" and ""Did you let folks know what you actually delivered
so there's some clarity there"".? Stuff happens, and if you chain people to their Release Plans,
they will be both timid in them, and also incredibly resistant to actually trying to put into
them things that other folks need that are less central to what they care about.? So I would be very reluctant to consider 'late' or
'didn't deliver everything listed in release' plan, because I suspect they'd incent very damaging
compensating behaviors.? If someone shows up to a project willing to do some useful work the project
thinks is a good idea... dinging the project for it not happening will strongly incent turning them away
(the opposite of what we want).? And if I depend on something from another project for one of my deliverables...
I am very unlikely to take the risk of putting that deliverable in my plan if I'm going to be dinged for it.? It tends to
discourage, rather than encourage collaboration and striving.

In some sense, thinking through things like the question you just raised here, is part of why *actually* changing
the governance (with the attendant thought and care) seems much more reasonable to me than what, to me, feels
like very broad creep by interpretation.? The project lifecycle change process forces rather a lot more deliberation.

I'm actually quite open to discussions about ""Lets look at whether we want to rework the project lifecycle"".? I'm going to have
my own principles around that which I feel passionate about (like trying to keep it mechanical and not political,
and trying to make it obvious to a reasonable engineer)... but those personal biases (much as I may be fond of them,
and wish others would adopt them, and much as I'd advocate for them) are not necessarily binding on such a discussion.

11,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/,advisory-group,message,[advisory-group] TSC request for comment: Graduation Review,"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 10:45:01 -0700",newman at hep.caltech.edu (Harvey Newman),<56097C9D.9070600@hep.caltech.edu>,"Dear Chris and All,

There is a large difference, in my mind, between stable and mature.

It is correct that to be effective, a given release needs to be mature.

The usual definition of a mature release is that it is fully functional and
well-documented, that in runs fault-free on a sufficient, verified set 
of hardware and
OS platforms, and that a body of users (not just committers) verifies
that it can be used without substantial issues on the afore-mentioned
platforms, for an identified set of benchmark functions and use cases.

At present, we have heard several opinions that the documentation
is not in the required state, and whether the code release works on a
given switch/router in a given configuration or not, is to be determined
by trial and error.

Best regards
Harvey

This is exactly the type of question we shouldn't be guessing as to what end users want and expect but getting real input and data. Mature is inherently a label who's primary use is to convey a certain level of expectations for an end-users. We should make sure that whatever process we ask a project to follow to measure whether they get this label fits as well as we can with what an end-user would assume such a label means (My 7 year old definitely thinks he exhibits a high level of maturity, and based on his own definition of maturity he probably does. Unfortunately for him it doesn't so much matter whether he meets his own definition of mature but whether he meets ours). Phil and Todd can facilitate formulating the questions, and/or creating a forum for discussion.

""mature"" project is a good topic for sure. It'd be really helpful to have someone who knows the current definition/flow well enough to give us some dump first and with  some Q&A time.

Subject: [advisory-group] TSC request for comment: Graduation Review

Advisors,

The TSC is asking for any suggestions we may have regarding the graduation review of a project that would indicate a project is ?mature?; please see the thread below.

Note that the TSC indicates that the meaning of ?mature? is already defined (see link below). We?re not being asked to debate the semantic use of the word, rather the state a project must be in to qualify as a ?fully functioning, successful open source project.?

This is our first formal such request; I suggest we discuss on-list and at the end of the week I?ll see if we have any conclusions to summarize.

Cheers,
Chris.

The really succinct, statement is we're trying to to come to an agreement about what the TSC should bear in mind and ask for as collateral when we start holding graduation reviews to move projects to mature. Note that graduation reviews and mature are technical terms defined in the project lifecycle document here:
https://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases
This thread should serve as good, if lengthy, background on what that question including differing opinions on what can be (and should be) in scope for the review under our current governing documents as well as what we might like to see if we were willing to change our governing documents. Any input from the Advisory Group on either or both of those would be interesting and much appreciated.

Cheers,
--Colin

I skimmed the thread and definitely think the AG can provide some guidance. 

Could I ask for a succinct statement of the query and its background? To make sure we answer the right question :)

I'll save my own detailed comments for later, save that as Neela suggests the word 'mature' has much implied meaning for end users around fitness for purpose derived in no small part from having mileage under its belt (preferably miles that were honest about their emissions too).

Can I suggest that you ask our Advisory Group members what they would expect as users from a Mature project? This is exactly the type of question we shouldn't be guessing as to what end users want and expect but getting real input and data. Mature is inherently a label who's primary use is to convey a certain level of expectations for an end-users. We should make sure that whatever process we ask a project to follow to measure whether they get this label fits as well as we can with what an end-user would assume such a label means (My 7 year old definitely thinks he exhibits a high level of maturity, and based on his own definition of maturity he probably does. Unfortunately for him it doesn't so much matter whether he meets his own definition of mature but whether he meets ours). Phil and Todd can facilitate formulating the questions, and/or creating a forum for discussion.

That's not what I had in mind, which makes me think I'm misunderstanding something. I wasn't around when this was written, so that seems likely.

Sticking with the security example, I'm proposing we make use of the

History of Releases -> Release Review -> Security Issues

chain to consider ""opinions about the contents of [the] 'Security Issues'
section"" during Graduation Reviews.

Sure... I would find it pretty reasonable to follow the links to the Release Reviews and look at their Security Issues sections.  That's just taking a look at the supporting collateral backing the claim for having followed the Mature Release process.
 

Coming back to what I may be misunderstanding...

Is ""Maturity"" here just about following the process, creating the right wikis at the right times and such? A project with a Release Review that says all the most horrible things (late, introduced malware, whatever) can be ""Mature"", as long as they follow the process? Or am I missing a step that would block such projects from reaching ""Mature""?

Yeah, that is an interesting question.  Part of the intention as I remember it originally was to have Mature be mostly mechanical and not political (thus its requirements are mostly mechanical, and not political), and to try to have it be stuff that would be pretty obviously true or false after the fact (example: Working code base.  Definitely tricky to lay out a precise set of ticky boxes for without having a code base in front of you, but not all that hard to determine about a code base you are looking at).

Late is an interesting question, because the Mature Release process is *not* the Simultaneous Release process... its most definitely simpler.  For example, the TSC *can* (and does, often for reasons I whole heartedly endorse) layer on quite a bit more structure than the Mature Release Process does.
As written, the Mature Release Process is mostly about ""Did you let folks know what you thought you thought you were doing so there was some hope of non-insider engaging"" and ""Did you let folks know what you actually delivered so there's some clarity there"".  Stuff happens, and if you chain people to their Release Plans, they will be both timid in them, and also incredibly resistant to actually trying to put into them things that other folks need that are less central to what they care about.  So I would be very reluctant to consider 'late' or 'didn't deliver everything listed in release' plan, because I suspect they'd incent very damaging compensating behaviors.  If someone shows up to a project willing to do some useful work the project thinks is a good idea... dinging the project for it not happening will strongly incent turning them away (the opposite of what we want).  And if I depend on something from another project for one of my deliverables...
I am very unlikely to take the risk of putting that deliverable in my plan if I'm going to be dinged for it.  It tends to discourage, rather than encourage collaboration and striving.

In some sense, thinking through things like the question you just raised here, is part of why *actually* changing the governance (with the attendant thought and care) seems much more reasonable to me than what, to me, feels like very broad creep by interpretation.  The project lifecycle change process forces rather a lot more deliberation.

I'm actually quite open to discussions about ""Lets look at whether we want to rework the project lifecycle"".  I'm going to have my own principles around that which I feel passionate about (like trying to keep it mechanical and not political, and trying to make it obvious to a reasonable engineer)... but those personal biases (much as I may be fond of them, and wish others would adopt them, and much as I'd advocate for them) are not necessarily binding on such a discussion.

To  me - mature means that project is fully functioning and being used externally and the only feedback are bug fixes and minor enhancements envisioned after 2 releases.
If there are major enhancements within 2 releases - it is in incubation mode still.

One can change the number of releases....

I'm sure Phil (who I think is on this list) can give us that detail; though just pulling that email thread up gives you a lot of background.

Stable project for me means exactly that: the software runs and has no erratic behaviour and I can therefore trust it when I use it. Mature is when I have good documentation on top of that.

for me a stable software (project) requires:

* major bugs are fixed within x (x=?) days
* minor bugs should be fixed

for me a mature software (project) requires:
* it is documented on a expert and non expert level, what the software should do
* it is documented how to use the software
* a documentation covering securitiy is available to describe the secure installation and usage of the software
* the software features are bound to major version numbers
   * bug fixes keep the major version number, but add a new minor version number
   * feature enhancements of the software require a new major version number
* the software has no known major bugs and only a few minor bugs
* an extended software QA is running to avoid major bugs
* a bugtools is available to document bugs and possible workarounds
   * major bugs are fixed within x days
   * minor bugs are fixed within y days or a workaround is available
* a security management process is in place to handle CVEs

I agree with the notion that the s/w should be in-use by more than one independant external user.  Perhaps more specifically it should be at least 2 independant users/organisations, and the software should be used in a production environment (ie, not for lab experimentation).

The challenging part is demonstrating ""many users"" in a production setting, especially when it's not yet mature. It's sometimes difficult to know that this is the case, for example.

This is good stuff everyone, keep it coming!

Hi,

for me a stable software (project) requires:
* it is documented on a expert level, what the software should do
* the software has no known major bugs --> so I can expect that the promised functions are working
* a software QA is running to avoid major bugs
* major bugs are fixed within x (x=?) days
* minor bugs should be fixed

for me a mature software (project) requires:
* it is documented on a expert and non expert level, what the software should do
* it is documented how to use the software
* a documentation covering securitiy is available to describe the secure installation and usage of the software
* the software features are bound to major version numbers
   * bug fixes keep the major version number, but add a new minor version number
   * feature enhancements of the software require a new major version number
* the software has no known major bugs and only a few minor bugs
* an extended software QA is running to avoid major bugs
* a bugtools is available to document bugs and possible workarounds
   * major bugs are fixed within x days
   * minor bugs are fixed within y days or a workaround is available
* a security management process is in place to handle CVEs
* the software is used by many users - I do not expect, that a software part of Opendaylight used by only one company/user can reach the mature state.

Regards
Ralf

Please let me know if there are any objections by EOD Friday (10/2).

The Advisory Group feels that mature and stable are different things. In general, mature is seen as a higher standard than stable. A checklist of items that broadly define stable and mature could include:

Stable
* Complete documentation exists that is suitable for experts which explains how to configure and use the key project features.
* The project has no known major issues; users of it have the expectation that the software works as advertised.
* There is a QA process to catch and avoid major issues making it into a release. This QA process includes a set of identified environments (hardware, software, O/S, etc).
* There is some minimum interval between subsequent stable releases.

* Once released, there is a commitment to repair any new major issues within some advertised time frame.
* Once released, there is a commitment to attempt to repair minor issues before the next release.

Mature
* The project has been included, as a stable release, in at least two major releases of the parent project.
* The project has multiple users; to be considered mature, several end-users must be actively using the project and ideally several are using it in production. To be mature, the expectation is that the user base of that project has some quantifiable experience of using it.
* Potentially the community-at-large should have some say on whether a project graduates to mature.
* Complete documentation exists for non-experts which explains how to configure, use and maintain all the project features.
* A security guide exists that identifies all known areas that need attention with suggestions on how to secure them.
* A security process exists to handle emergent CVEs.
* The project has no known major issues and only very few minor issues.
* The QA process includes steps that attempt to catch and avoid both major and minor issues.

* Software releases are bound to their version numbers; minor release = increment minor version component, major release = increment major version component.
** Fixes for issues are included in minor releases.
** Minor enhancements may be included in minor releases if there is identifiable benefit.
** All other enhancements require a new major release.
** Major releases have some degree of minimum interval.

* Once released, there is a commitment to repair any new major issues within some advertised time frame.
* Once released, there is a commitment to attempt to repair minor issues before the next release, noting the expectation that few minor issues are acceptable in a new release.
* There is some indication that the project will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future; and that the community will manage a graceful exit of the project if that becomes necessary.

Long term support is indeed an important factor.  Long term commitment could
also be gauged by if a project would continue to be a place for innovations
from the community.

I agree with this summary.

I also wonder, next, whether some of the issues with the Lithium 
release, and
how to deal with the issues of maturity and usability, can be brought 
out and discussed.
Perhaps in a separate  thread and with a different perspective.

Best regards
Harvey

Objet?: Re: [advisory-group] TSC request for comment: Graduation Review

Okay everyone, here's my summarized version of the thread (which I've shared with Colin already to see if it's a useful format and will post back to the TSC thread shortly):


The Advisory Group feels that mature and stable are different things. In general, mature is seen as a higher standard than stable. A checklist of items that broadly define stable and mature could include:

Stable
* Complete documentation exists that is suitable for experts which explains how to configure and use the key project features.
* The project has no known major issues; users of it have the expectation that the software works as advertised.
* There is a QA process to catch and avoid major issues making it into a release. This QA process includes a set of identified environments (hardware, software, O/S, etc).
* There is some minimum interval between subsequent stable releases.

* Once released, there is a commitment to repair any new major issues within some advertised time frame.
* Once released, there is a commitment to attempt to repair minor issues before the next release.

Mature
* The project has been included, as a stable release, in at least two major releases of the parent project.
* The project has multiple users; to be considered mature, several end-users must be actively using the project and ideally several are using it in production. To be mature, the expectation is that the user base of that project has some quantifiable experience of using it.
* Potentially the community-at-large should have some say on whether a project graduates to mature.
* Complete documentation exists for non-experts which explains how to configure, use and maintain all the project features.
* A security guide exists that identifies all known areas that need attention with suggestions on how to secure them.
* A security process exists to handle emergent CVEs.
* The project has no known major issues and only very few minor issues.
* The QA process includes steps that attempt to catch and avoid both major and minor issues.

* Software releases are bound to their version numbers; minor release = increment minor version component, major release = increment major version component.
** Fixes for issues are included in minor releases.
** Minor enhancements may be included in minor releases if there is identifiable benefit.
** All other enhancements require a new major release.
** Major releases have some degree of minimum interval.

* Once released, there is a commitment to repair any new major issues within some advertised time frame.
* Once released, there is a commitment to attempt to repair minor issues before the next release, noting the expectation that few minor issues are acceptable in a new release.
* There is some indication that the project will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future; and that the community will manage a graceful exit of the project if that becomes necessary.

Chris.

Long term support is indeed an important factor.  Long term commitment could also be gauged by if a project would continue to be a place for innovations from the community.

One thought is that if ODL could do more ?marketing?  on how ODL helps with
the actual operators solutions (like Neela showed on Friday in his keynote),
or just some specific technology solutions, that would attract more traffic.
Maybe we just get used to that ODL could do anything
but others may not know
it, and many are typically seeking for something that tends to be specific.

There were about 8 people in the audience for the ODL summit, 25 for MEF,
and 100 +/- for OPNFV.  Too many concurrent sessions, and as Pedro
mentioned, mostly high-level. That said, the hallway conversations and
dinner meetings were useful.

We seem to be saying we want a more technical venue, which is good (an operationally focused one, perhaps). But with the number of conferences there are currently my leadership is pushing back on travel quite hard; they're looking for some consolidation. Maybe there's room for a neutral conference to spring up, or for the various projects to come together, have joint technical meetings (with some dev and also some ops focus) and limit these conferences to 2 or 3 per year.

The marketing events can happen as often as they want - but we need to transition into much more of a ""doing"" industry.

There are more organizations planning on going to the linux foundation.
So linux can create maybe a collaboration summit for NFV-SDN folks - like they have linuxcon and

Openstack, though, is a different story - already too big.

That seems to play in to the stuff we've already been talking about around showing how to do specific things.

We seem to be saying we want a more technical venue, which is good (an operationally focused one, perhaps). But with the number of conferences there are currently my leadership is pushing back on travel quite hard; they're looking for some consolidation. Maybe there's room for a neutral conference to spring up, or for the various projects to come together, have joint technical meetings (with some dev and also some ops focus) and limit these conferences to 2 or 3 per year.

The marketing events can happen as often as they want - but we need to transition into much more of a ""doing"" industry.

Chris.

One thought is that if ODL could do more ""marketing""  on how ODL helps with the actual operators solutions (like Neela showed on Friday in his keynote), or just some specific technology solutions, that would attract more traffic. Maybe we just get used to that ODL could do anything...but others may not know it, and many are typically seeking for something that tends to be specific.

@ Margaret, Mostly OK, but with a simple objection. Most, if not all of those conferences happen outside Europe, which makes it for people like me a couple of levels tougher to assist.
@ Chris, definitely true, hallway conversations and dinner meetings were useful.

There were about 8 people in the audience for the ODL summit, 25 for MEF, and 100 +/- for OPNFV.  Too many concurrent sessions, and as Pedro mentioned, mostly high-level. That said, the hallway conversations and dinner meetings were useful.

Colin and I have been discussing the upcoming Boron release. The TSC would like to seek our input on the release, and in particular what's ""most missing"" from the current plans so I have invited Colin, at the next call, to present us with the plans such as they may currently be and then we can provide feedback, either/both in the remainder of the call or on this list.

For some background material, here's some details Colin shared with me.

Release topics were on the last TSC agenda: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/TSC:Main#Agenda

Mostly, these items are not project-specific, but more about how we can fix some issues we've had in past releases, including:

* doing a release faster than 6 months?
* allow for compatibility between releases, e.g., ""apps"" in the Boron release should be able to run on Beryllium
* provide support for programmatic upgrades, e.g., no or minimal human effort to upgrade from Beryllium to Boron
* support for continuous release for individual projects

Naturally, the TSC has already heard about the importance of documentation and compatibility in future releases, so we don't need to focus on those too much.

Cheers,
Chris.

Asunto: [advisory-group] Agenda for Thursdays AG call

All,

Colin and I have been discussing the upcoming Boron release. The TSC would like to seek our input on the release, and in particular what?s ?most missing? from the current plans so I have invited Colin, at the next call, to present us with the plans such as they may currently be and then we can provide feedback, either/both in the remainder of the call or on this list.

For some background material, here?s some details Colin shared with me.

Release topics were on the last TSC agenda: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/TSC:Main#Agenda

Mostly, these items are not project-specific, but more about how we can fix some issues we've had in past releases, including:

* doing a release faster than 6 months?

IMvHO that would give an impression of lack of stability and may deter a couple of users in the ?corporate spectrum?.

* allow for compatibility between releases, e.g., ""apps"" in the Boron release should be able to run on Beryllium

Backwards compatibility would be a more than nice to have feature. The other way round may create confusion.

* provide support for programmatic upgrades, e.g., no or minimal human effort to upgrade from Beryllium to Boron

1++ This is an absolute MUST. I would really pay attention to the cases where it is not possible to have a zero-effort upgrade and make sure that the platform provides clear information on what steps to follow to fix incompatibilities. That is not typically the case in a stack trace :-)

* support for continuous release for individual projects

Naturally, the TSC has already heard about the importance of documentation and compatibility in future releases, so we don?t need to focus on those too much.

Cheers,
Chris.

In addition, here is some food for thought for the core team:

There is something that is bugging me. Imagine I have two applications running independently on top of the SAL. These two applications, at a given point in time, send commands towards one and the same network element and these commands happen to be contradictory: like activate and shut down an interface or forward and drop a packet, etc. How should ODL handle this situations to produce a predictable and reproduce-able behaviour?

Best, /PA

69,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/,advisory-group,message,[advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF,"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 15:46:45 +0000","Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com (Luke, Chris)",<9897d2e8a5614ea09ee37a1ab31645e6@VAADCEX32.cable.comcast.com>,"Advisors,

We have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.

The summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don?t conform to ODL?s interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn?t parse according to a YANG model defined for it.

Pass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.

Another approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a ?sloppy mount?). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.

Anyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?

Personally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or ?in development?) devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin?s comment though: We shouldn?t unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.

Cheers,
Chris.

-          Core is only a functional state; it labels items critical to the system, upon which other key features depend. Care must be taken to not make 'core' a subjective label.

-          Mature and stable are quality labels; even though we can discern more than one such state, end-users really only care about a label that gives them confidence that the system will work as expected. This end-user expectation may vary and that is where the difference between stable and mature comes in. (stable may be good enough for the lab; mature required for production, for example)

-          There is a loose relationship between functional states and quality states; though arguably a core project needs to be stable/mature in order for dependent projects to also be stable/mature.

Is this a fair summary?

Cheers,
Chris.

Yes, busy in Dusselfdorf with WIFI hunt....

""mature"", ""stable"" are quality state. Whether we have one or two depends on what we can really accomplish when ""enforce"" each of the state.  I prefer to have just one state here from use end.

I think ""core"" belongs to functionality categorization.  It should be clearly separated from quality state.  I'm interested to know how would we determine and mark ""core"".  Keep in mind one ""core"" to someone may not be ""core"" to other.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Mature vs. Core

I think core means it is mandatory to the platform vs optional. That is different from stable.
Stable is a criteria for maturity - so maybe we just merge to one term and list all the characteristics - stable and mature definitions combine and pick one as the category/stage.
Then Core features progress to different development stages which eventually get to stable/mature.

The TSC has had a brief discussion after our comments last week and they are seeking some clarity between ""core"" and ""mature"", since we added the concept of ""stable"" in our response.

The thread is here: https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2015-October/003983.html

The summary is (paraphrasing both Colin and Ed):

                Given that we currently have two lifecycle states, ""mature"" and ""core"", what do we want ""mature"" to mean and what do we want ""core"" to mean?
Do we envisage a third pre-requisite state called ""stable""?

The ODL TSC met today and discussed the potential of a 2 week slip in the
Beryllium Schedule.  This would move the release date from Feb. 4 to Feb.
18, 2016.

The potential slippage is caused by an issue that impacted the development
of several ODL projects, and those projects are asking for a Release Date
delay to recover the time lost.

The ODL TSC will make a decision on this early next week.  Before doing so,
I was asked to reach out our various stakeholders, such as the Advisory
Group, to understand any negative (or less likely positive) impacts that
this may cause for your organizations.

Please respond with any feedback that you have at your earliest
opportunity.

Thanks in advance for your help with this.

Either way, assuming the violations are not structurally ambiguous, I feel that being able to be tolerant of such issues is important; but we should have the option of being pedantic. To dissuade vendors from insisting we always operate in the relaxed mode, perhaps call the option ?this-vendors-implementation-is-horribly-broken?. :)

I?m not keen on pass-through though. I think ODL?s northbound should always be well-behaved. If the data cannot be parsed with a liberally tolerant parser, it?s bad data.

Subject: [advisory-group] Request for Feedback - Potential 2 week slip for ODL Beryllium

Hello OpenDaylight Advisory Group members:

The ODL TSC met today and discussed the potential of a 2 week slip in the Beryllium Schedule.  This would move the release date from Feb. 4 to Feb. 18, 2016.

The potential slippage is caused by an issue that impacted the development of several ODL projects, and those projects are asking for a Release Date delay to recover the time lost.

The ODL TSC will make a decision on this early next week.  Before doing so, I was asked to reach out our various stakeholders, such as the Advisory Group, to understand any negative (or less likely positive) impacts that this may cause for your organizations.

Please respond with any feedback that you have at your earliest opportunity.

Thanks in advance for your help with this.

Best,

Phil.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

I didn?t see a clear distinction in the notes between the two issues: NETCONF protocol issues and XML-schema-conformance issues, but I am seeing hints of both.

Either way, assuming the violations are not structurally ambiguous, I feel that being able to be tolerant of such issues is important; but we should have the option of being pedantic. To dissuade vendors from insisting we always operate in the relaxed mode, perhaps call the option ?this-vendors-implementation-is-horribly-broken?. :)

I?m not keen on pass-through though. I think ODL?s northbound should always be well-behaved. If the data cannot be parsed with a liberally tolerant parser, it?s bad data.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Hi Chris -
Trying to dissect the issue -
Is the issue actually NETCONF ?  IE, the transport protocol itself isn't working properly with some device implementations? Or is it that the device is not compliant with its own advertised YANG schema definition in terms of the returned XML following a NETCONF call (eg GET-CONFIG).
Sounded like the latter?
At TR we're likely to be heavy users of the netconf southbound - If NETCONF is ok but but the advertised YANG is outside of the expected schema spec in some way I'd like options to deal with it upstream of the controller
rather than it failing at the controller.  Being able to switch the controller into a 'loose' vs 'strict' mode of operation would be nice, on a per-model basis. That way we can test and potentially troubleshoot issues in loose mode and feedback to vendors if their device is misbehaving with our upstream application, or even trap and deal with exception within the upstream app (depends on the schema violation - some may not be that critical to the app in question).

Subject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF
Advisors,

We have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.

The summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don?t conform to ODL?s interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn?t parse according to a YANG model defined for it.

Pass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.

Another approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a ?sloppy mount?). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.

Anyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?

Personally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or ?in development?) devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin?s comment though: We shouldn?t unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.

Cheers,
Chris.

We need a looser version that allows us to work with devices that support netconf but don't have yang models for instance.

It may need to be a different interface - one where the app is responsible for crafting the payload but ODL  puts the xml return into a XML tree as a blob and the app has to xpath into the tree or something like that (hand waving).

NetConf-Lite which would be a separate mount type that would allow us to work with vendor equipment that isn't fully netconf + yang  compatible.
Even Cisco has netconf interfaces without the corresponding YANG models. We know this from the vRR interface.

Last year, ODL was the only open source controller in town. Now,
especially with OPNFV and ONOS, there is a lot more dissipation of
attention.

I think that one room covering OPNFV, ONOS, ODL would be a better draw
next year - two high-impact ODL presentations would be better than a
full day of poorly attended ones.

Thanks,

devices is something we're aware of and thinking about. We've been making a
lot of progress on the topic in a specific domain around OpenFlow and
multiple apps controlling vSwitches when there is a combination
applications attempting to provide network virtualization and service
chaining.

The ideas we've been developing and some of the code we've started writing
could be generalized, but it's not a panacea. We'd probably need to know
what protocols you were interested in for this. Cross-protocol things are
possible, but much more complex.

I'll add this to the list of things I've heard people asking for.

Subject: RE: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core

So summarizing, and adding my comments:


-          Core is only a functional state; it labels items critical to the system, upon which other key features depend. Care must be taken to not make 'core' a subjective label.

-          Mature and stable are quality labels; even though we can discern more than one such state, end-users really only care about a label that gives them confidence that the system will work as expected. This end-user expectation may vary and that is where the difference between stable and mature comes in. (stable may be good enough for the lab; mature required for production, for example)

-          There is a loose relationship between functional states and quality states; though arguably a core project needs to be stable/mature in order for dependent projects to also be stable/mature.

Is this a fair summary?

Cheers,
Chris.

Yes, busy in Dusselfdorf with WIFI hunt....

""mature"", ""stable"" are quality state. Whether we have one or two depends on what we can really accomplish when ""enforce"" each of the state.  I prefer to have just one state here from use end.

I think ""core"" belongs to functionality categorization.  It should be clearly separated from quality state.  I'm interested to know how would we determine and mark ""core"".  Keep in mind one ""core"" to someone may not be ""core"" to other.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Mature vs. Core

I think core means it is mandatory to the platform vs optional. That is different from stable.
Stable is a criteria for maturity - so maybe we just merge to one term and list all the characteristics - stable and mature definitions combine and pick one as the category/stage.
Then Core features progress to different development stages which eventually get to stable/mature.

Subject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core

The TSC has had a brief discussion after our comments last week and they are seeking some clarity between ""core"" and ""mature"", since we added the concept of ""stable"" in our response.

The thread is here: https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2015-October/003983.html

The summary is (paraphrasing both Colin and Ed):

                Given that we currently have two lifecycle states, ""mature"" and ""core"", what do we want ""mature"" to mean and what do we want ""core"" to mean?
Do we envisage a third pre-requisite state called ""stable""?

Thanks for the reality check. We have been also doing some research on that and this is our current take too: could be something you might want to do in a specific domain (and OF is a good candidate, while netconf might no because it?s more difficult to extract meta-information about the clash there) while going cross technology/domain/protocol is extremely complex.

Asunto: Re: [advisory-group] Agenda for Thursdays AG call

For what it's worth, dealing with conflicting commands being sent to devices is something we're aware of and thinking about. We've been making a lot of progress on the topic in a specific domain around OpenFlow and multiple apps controlling vSwitches when there is a combination applications attempting to provide network virtualization and service chaining.

The ideas we've been developing and some of the code we've started writing could be generalized, but it's not a panacea. We'd probably need to know what protocols you were interested in for this. Cross-protocol things are possible, but much more complex.

I'll add this to the list of things I've heard people asking for.

Asunto: [advisory-group] Agenda for Thursdays AG call

All,

Colin and I have been discussing the upcoming Boron release. The TSC would like to seek our input on the release, and in particular what?s ?most missing? from the current plans so I have invited Colin, at the next call, to present us with the plans such as they may currently be and then we can provide feedback, either/both in the remainder of the call or on this list.

For some background material, here?s some details Colin shared with me.

Release topics were on the last TSC agenda: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/TSC:Main#Agenda

Mostly, these items are not project-specific, but more about how we can fix some issues we've had in past releases, including:

* doing a release faster than 6 months?

IMvHO that would give an impression of lack of stability and may deter a couple of users in the ?corporate spectrum?.

* allow for compatibility between releases, e.g., ""apps"" in the Boron release should be able to run on Beryllium

Backwards compatibility would be a more than nice to have feature. The other way round may create confusion.

* provide support for programmatic upgrades, e.g., no or minimal human effort to upgrade from Beryllium to Boron

1++ This is an absolute MUST. I would really pay attention to the cases where it is not possible to have a zero-effort upgrade and make sure that the platform provides clear information on what steps to follow to fix incompatibilities. That is not typically the case in a stack trace :-)

* support for continuous release for individual projects

Naturally, the TSC has already heard about the importance of documentation and compatibility in future releases, so we don?t need to focus on those too much.

Cheers,
Chris.

In addition, here is some food for thought for the core team:

There is something that is bugging me. Imagine I have two applications running independently on top of the SAL. These two applications, at a given point in time, send commands towards one and the same network element and these commands happen to be contradictory: like activate and shut down an interface or forward and drop a packet, etc. How should ODL handle this situations to produce a predictable and reproduce-able behaviour?

Best, /PA

Same here I suspect. We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.

Also, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.  Given ALU's already complex Service provisioning model (my opinion), this makes lack of NETCONF/YANG a PITA.

Same here I suspect. We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.

In that example, is the controller adding any value? Or is it a glorified connection pooler? The risk is that it forces what I would consider a layer violation: a bunch of state being managed in an app that should be in the controller. But perhaps it's unavoidable in some cases. Pesky vendors.

Yes, I've been meaning to mention this.  Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Yep, handling CLI is really hard  - the NEDs do it fairly well but not perfectly in all cases out-of-the-box.  The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.
Other thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.  That to me would be really cool to have in ODL.

More correctly, for legacy devices the NED defines a YANG model to describe the CLI; the remainder of the NED provides a mechanism to talk to that device. This hits issues when there are inconsistencies between versions of the CLI, for example.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

If I understand things correctly, commercial products like Tail-F have developed NED's (Network Element Drivers) that are non-NETCONF/YANG based and instead use CLI to interface to devices that are not (yet) NETCONF/YANG compliant or where the customer is still running an old OS version that is in the same boat.

Have we considered some projects to do the same?  I think the goal is to be able to have ODL cover all devices in the network despite their lack of NETCONF/YANG support.  I know we are in this boat which is why Tail-F looks so attractive to TMO.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Yep, handling CLI is really hard  - the NEDs do it fairly well but not perfectly in all cases out-of-the-box.  The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.
Other thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.  That to me would be really cool to have in ODL.

More correctly, for legacy devices the NED defines a YANG model to describe the CLI; the remainder of the NED provides a mechanism to talk to that device. This hits issues when there are inconsistencies between versions of the CLI, for example.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

If I understand things correctly, commercial products like Tail-F have developed NED's (Network Element Drivers) that are non-NETCONF/YANG based and instead use CLI to interface to devices that are not (yet) NETCONF/YANG compliant or where the customer is still running an old OS version that is in the same boat.

Have we considered some projects to do the same?  I think the goal is to be able to have ODL cover all devices in the network despite their lack of NETCONF/YANG support.  I know we are in this boat which is why Tail-F looks so attractive to TMO.

Same here I suspect. We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.

Asunto: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

We basically have been telling vendors for future releases (SW/HW) that they must migrate to Netconf and provide YANG models for their equipment.
At least it forces the vendors to have to go through our grilling exceptions process of why they can?t get to netconf.
We then use Tail-F for the CLI ones as an ODL intelligent adapter.

Hi,

I figured it?d perhaps be polite to introduce myself before posting to this group. I am Johan Gustawsson, SDN&NFV Network Architect at TeliaSonera Group. I think Todd will upload a bio to the AG page shortly.
Anyhow, I am really excited to be a part of this group and hope to contribute with our experiences and ongoing work involving ODL.

I also think the needed polishing of CLI NEDs to make poorly written operating systems work in every situation and version is a different (and never-ending) story.
Although I like what Tail-F does apart from the caveats already mentioned in this thread ? Network-wide transactions in ODL is something we?d welcome and be happy to contribute to.

Subject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Yes, I've been meaning to mention this.  Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.

Also, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.  Given ALU's already complex Service provisioning model (my opinion), this makes lack of NETCONF/YANG a PITA.

I'm curious if this means that you'd like to see an entire query rejected
because a mandatory integer field contained ""fred"" or if you'd like to be
able to get the rest of the data.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Same here I suspect. We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.

We will be at phases. App (VNF) may not give total control to controller. I agree on target ? but question
is do we get to target where controller has all state in 1 step, 2, 3?. Which is why you allow the looser control.
We have this debate internally all the time w/r to getting to target architecture/implementation.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

In that example, is the controller adding any value? Or is it a glorified connection pooler? The risk is that it forces what I would consider a layer violation: a bunch of state being managed in an app that should be in the controller. But perhaps it?s unavoidable in some cases. Pesky vendors.

There are solutions to that... :-P

That makes sense. I think it might behoove us to be clear as I think the
underlying question was when and if it's OK for the NETCONF plugin to drop
information on the floor because of violations (real or perceived) of the
NETCONF protocol or provided YANG schemas. The current prevailing opinion
of the most involved engineers angles toward being more strict. Along those
lines, if our users have a different opinion, it would be food to make that
clear.

This lets us deal with valid xml that doesn?t have the niceties of a specific namespace for every tag vs inferred namespace, etc.
2. pushing data is easier since we will have a payload from the vendor of the xml that is to be pushed in edit-config
3. pulling data (get-config) is harder because ODL needs to know what to do with data that does not have a matching yang model.
	a. I would think something like anyxml could be used to let the application do the mapping.
	b. It would be nicer for the service provider/application to provide a mapping file from the xml xpath A to yang datapath B but maybe that ends up being just as much work as having the vendor provide a yang model.
	c. I would be happy with the netconf-lite adaptor providing a pointer to ""this is the result of get-config"" . the application could parse it using your standard XML tools and we can do the mapping in our application.
	d. netconf-lite assumes that application does the xml input and xml parsing as step 1.
	e. options on top of netconf-lite would provide xml parsing to a generic set of leafs into md-sal of a get-config (but not sure how hard/easy that is)

Updated summary:

* Distinguish between NETCONF protocol issues and YANG schema conformance in the payload.
* Loose mode for both is strongly desirable.
* Especially to support devices that may not yet have a model, or it's known to be incomplete.
* For schema conformance loose mode, consider making it a per-model tweak.
* Loose mode should only apply when violations are not structurally ambiguous. Data that cannot be deserialized by a reasonably tolerant parser should always be rejected. This means bad XML (syntactically broken - unbalanced nesting, missing >'s and so on) should probably not be accepted, but semantic issues (not passing yang schema checks, like elements not passing type tests or whole data structures not being defined in the schema at all) should be tolerable. Likewise NETCONF transport issues that are not ambiguous should be tolerable too.
* ODL northbound should always be well behaved; passthrough must be carefully considered, possibly with a separate endpoint (to make its use explicit in apps)
* Expect end users to come up with esoteric conditions down the road; when stuff is in production things need to work, even if it's sometimes kludgy. Especially during the next few years with much legacy equipment deployed the need for tolerance in protocols is that bit greater.

Asunto: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

We basically have been telling vendors for future releases (SW/HW) that they must migrate to Netconf and provide YANG models for their equipment.
At least it forces the vendors to have to go through our grilling exceptions process of why they can?t get to netconf.
We then use Tail-F for the CLI ones as an ODL intelligent adapter.

Hi,

I figured it?d perhaps be polite to introduce myself before posting to this group. I am Johan Gustawsson, SDN&NFV Network Architect at TeliaSonera Group. I think Todd will upload a bio to the AG page shortly.
Anyhow, I am really excited to be a part of this group and hope to contribute with our experiences and ongoing work involving ODL.

I also think the needed polishing of CLI NEDs to make poorly written operating systems work in every situation and version is a different (and never-ending) story.
Although I like what Tail-F does apart from the caveats already mentioned in this thread ? Network-wide transactions in ODL is something we?d welcome and be happy to contribute to.

Yes, I've been meaning to mention this.  Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.

Also, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.  Given ALU's already complex Service provisioning model (my opinion), this makes lack of NETCONF/YANG a PITA.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Yep, handling CLI is really hard  - the NEDs do it fairly well but not perfectly in all cases out-of-the-box.  The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.
Other thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.  That to me would be really cool to have in ODL.

More correctly, for legacy devices the NED defines a YANG model to describe the CLI; the remainder of the NED provides a mechanism to talk to that device. This hits issues when there are inconsistencies between versions of the CLI, for example.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

If I understand things correctly, commercial products like Tail-F have developed NED's (Network Element Drivers) that are non-NETCONF/YANG based and instead use CLI to interface to devices that are not (yet) NETCONF/YANG compliant or where the customer is still running an old OS version that is in the same boat.

Have we considered some projects to do the same?  I think the goal is to be able to have ODL cover all devices in the network despite their lack of NETCONF/YANG support.  I know we are in this boat which is why Tail-F looks so attractive to TMO.

Same here I suspect. We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.

1. un-parseable payload should be rejected but we need to have loose enforcement of the parsing rules. This lets us deal with valid xml that doesn?t have the niceties of a specific namespace for every tag vs inferred namespace, etc.

2. pushing data is easier since we will have a payload from the vendor of the xml that is to be pushed in edit-config

3. pulling data (get-config) is harder because ODL needs to know what to do with data that does not have a matching yang model.

        a. I would think something like anyxml could be used to let the application do the mapping.

        b. It would be nicer for the service provider/application to provide a mapping file from the xml xpath A to yang datapath B but maybe that ends up being just as much work as having the vendor provide a yang model.

        c. I would be happy with the netconf-lite adaptor providing a pointer to ""this is the result of get-config"" . the application could parse it using your standard XML tools and we can do the mapping in our application.

        d. netconf-lite assumes that application does the xml input and xml parsing as step 1.

        e. options on top of netconf-lite would provide xml parsing to a generic set of leafs into md-sal of a get-config (but not sure how hard/easy that is)

Updated summary:



* Distinguish between NETCONF protocol issues and YANG schema conformance in the payload.

* Loose mode for both is strongly desirable.

* Especially to support devices that may not yet have a model, or it's known to be incomplete.

* For schema conformance loose mode, consider making it a per-model tweak.

* Loose mode should only apply when violations are not structurally ambiguous. Data that cannot be deserialized by a reasonably tolerant parser should always be rejected. This means bad XML (syntactically broken - unbalanced nesting, missing >'s and so on) should probably not be accepted, but semantic issues (not passing yang schema checks, like elements not passing type tests or whole data structures not being defined in the schema at all) should be tolerable. Likewise NETCONF transport issues that are not ambiguous should be tolerable too.

* ODL northbound should always be well behaved; passthrough must be carefully considered, possibly with a separate endpoint (to make its use explicit in apps)

* Expect end users to come up with esoteric conditions down the road; when stuff is in production things need to work, even if it's sometimes kludgy. Especially during the next few years with much legacy equipment deployed the need for tolerance in protocols is that bit greater.



Any tweaks, anyone? :)

Asunto: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

We basically have been telling vendors for future releases (SW/HW) that they must migrate to Netconf and provide YANG models for their equipment.
At least it forces the vendors to have to go through our grilling exceptions process of why they can?t get to netconf.
We then use Tail-F for the CLI ones as an ODL intelligent adapter.

Hi,

I figured it?d perhaps be polite to introduce myself before posting to this group. I am Johan Gustawsson, SDN&NFV Network Architect at TeliaSonera Group. I think Todd will upload a bio to the AG page shortly.
Anyhow, I am really excited to be a part of this group and hope to contribute with our experiences and ongoing work involving ODL.

I also think the needed polishing of CLI NEDs to make poorly written operating systems work in every situation and version is a different (and never-ending) story.
Although I like what Tail-F does apart from the caveats already mentioned in this thread ? Network-wide transactions in ODL is something we?d welcome and be happy to contribute to.

Subject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Yes, I've been meaning to mention this.  Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.

Also, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.  Given ALU's already complex Service provisioning model (my opinion), this makes lack of NETCONF/YANG a PITA.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Yep, handling CLI is really hard  - the NEDs do it fairly well but not perfectly in all cases out-of-the-box.  The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.
Other thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.  That to me would be really cool to have in ODL.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF
More correctly, for legacy devices the NED defines a YANG model to describe the CLI; the remainder of the NED provides a mechanism to talk to that device. This hits issues when there are inconsistencies between versions of the CLI, for example.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

If I understand things correctly, commercial products like Tail-F have developed NED's (Network Element Drivers) that are non-NETCONF/YANG based and instead use CLI to interface to devices that are not (yet) NETCONF/YANG compliant or where the customer is still running an old OS version that is in the same boat.

Have we considered some projects to do the same?  I think the goal is to be able to have ODL cover all devices in the network despite their lack of NETCONF/YANG support.  I know we are in this boat which is why Tail-F looks so attractive to TMO.

Subject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

Same here I suspect. We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF
We will be at phases. App (VNF) may not give total control to controller. I agree on target ? but question
is do we get to target where controller has all state in 1 step, 2, 3?. Which is why you allow the looser control.
We have this debate internally all the time w/r to getting to target architecture/implementation.

Subject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF

In that example, is the controller adding any value? Or is it a glorified connection pooler? The risk is that it forces what I would consider a layer violation: a bunch of state being managed in an app that should be in the controller. But perhaps it?s unavoidable in some cases. Pesky vendors.

Yes we at Caltech have had a similar experience,
including items such as the error counters not
being properly passed on.

I raised this general issue a while ago.
Testing, interaction with vendors and resolution
of issues, and establishment of known

firmware release, parameter settings etc.)
are important for wide community adoption.

However, not with things I would consider to be very fundamental. 

If the priority is to be raised, maybe we have to take part in defining what that means in practice and what we expect (on a lower level than just saying 'we expect it to work')? 
At the other end, are we as end-users doing enough to feed the information back and creating awareness about the specific misbehaviours/bugs? 

Your suggestion for a common statement from this group about the importance of this could be a great next step.

Maybe we are not in the position of defining specific interop testing for specific devices. However I would guess that we can voice our concern that there are basic features that don?t work against devices provided by the sponsors of the project. Am I completely unrealistic if I think that they are the first to want their devices working with ODL?

I think this needs two things.

At the OPNFV summit all week and have been pretty busy - we actually got around 750 participants
attending with many carriers who have attended now thinking of joining! So I've been inundated with back-back meetings..

Did someone agree to pull together the list of adapters- equipment to test against(I think that is what Chris asked for)? If not
I am willing. So just send me your list and I will pull AT&T's list together.

Subject: RE: [advisory-group] Interop testing with real network devices

I do think we have a role in this though. I'm not suggesting we govern anything, merely provide specific direction - because that is our remit.

If any among us can provide some test resources too, even better.

But right now I would rather us give a message of ""needs improvement, here's some specifics"" rather than ""it's broken, fix it."" We do ourselves no favors with the latter. The more we as a community give the better the result we get, yada yada.

Chris.

Yes we at Caltech have had a similar experience,
including items such as the error counters not
being properly passed on.

I raised this general issue a while ago.
Testing, interaction with vendors and resolution
of issues, and establishment of known
working configurations (switch models and
firmware release, parameter settings etc.)
are important for wide community adoption.
Especially if an ODL  release is to be declared
""production ready""

Sorry for not responding before now.  I would add ALU SRX 7750 routers to all of the categories.  We use a lot of those and I'd like to make sure those interoperate with ODL.  

Having said that, we are not yet up to an SRX release that supports NETCONF but I have been lead to believe that one of the newer versions (that we haven't tested in the lab yet) ""will"" support it.  Therefore, I'd like to see that on the list.

During the recent ODL Hackfest, community people discussed about to compile a set of use case demos, the target audience is end users.

I solicited some PTLs to provide video demos for their projects based on Beryllium release,  with Beryllium entering code freeze milestone, it probably is a good time for all projects to think about this.

This is the template I would like to get start: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/User_cases
The format is not final, we can discuss more in details. I would like PTLs to think about one or more use cases, provide a description of what problem you are to resolve, a brief steps how to setup in ODL, preferable a demo video for users to follow step by step. The goal is to enable user to download and run the ODL SDN controller.

I list some projects that agreed to provide demo videos, please feel free to add your project to the page,  I would also like to collect use cases from community users, please fill the following form with a use case you would like to see, or how to use ODL to achieve what you would like to do, we will circulate those in the community and see if we can provide a solution for your use case.

Subject: [advisory-group] Use case demo collections.

Hello ODL folks,

During the recent ODL Hackfest, community people discussed about to compile a set of use case demos, the target audience is end users.

I solicited some PTLs to provide video demos for their projects based on Beryllium release,  with Beryllium entering code freeze milestone, it probably is a good time for all projects to think about this.

This is the template I would like to get start: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/User_cases
The format is not final, we can discuss more in details. I would like PTLs to think about one or more use cases, provide a description of what problem you are to resolve, a brief steps how to setup in ODL, preferable a demo video for users to follow step by step. The goal is to enable user to download and run the ODL SDN controller.

I list some projects that agreed to provide demo videos, please feel free to add your project to the page,  I would also like to collect use cases from community users, please fill the following form with a use case you would like to see, or how to use ODL to achieve what you would like to do, we will circulate those in the community and see if we can provide a solution for your use case.

132,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/,advisory-group,message,"[advisory-group] Fwd: Re: [OpenDaylight TSC] [OpenDaylight Board]
 [OPENDAYLIGHT BYLAW WAIVER - TSC COMPOSITION] Discussion.","Tue, 8 Dec 2015 04:42:39 -0500",colin at colindixon.com (Colin Dixon),<CANPTM8HGRb2gQBH_R3aoi3Z-ctc0SMZ5BNCAJ=bNRT2VXqmBkw@mail.gmail.com>,"Dear Advisory Group,

As the mail below highlights, the TSC is in the process of discussing and
likely approving significant changes to who will sit on the TSC.

The major change is that we will likely be ending platinum designates
(appointed members from the platinum companies) as the major constituents
of the TSC. This is something that was intended since the beginning of
OpenDaylight; the platinum designates were only ever intended to be a
bootstrapping mechanism until the technical members of the community were
numerous enough and could be identified to make up the TSC. There appears
to be a strong belief that we have hit that point.

However, the original plan for the makeup of the TSC expected that there
would be core projects at this point and the PTLs of the core projects
would be the TSC members from the technical community. We do not yet have
core projects, so the current discussion is looking at having TSC members
come from a combination of committers-at-large (any committer could be
elected) and PTLs of projects (possibly with a preference to mature
projects).

Beyond this, there are discussions about whether PTLs should be drawn from
all projects with no categorization or if we should split projects into
different constituencies,  e.g., kernel, protocol,  and apps.

Lastly, there is discussion about capping the number of TSC members that
could come from any one company.

If you have thoughts on any of this and would like to chime in,  feel free
to do so here or on the TSC list.  The archives of discussion so far can be
found here:
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2015-December/thread.html
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2015-November/thread.html

Search for ""waiver"" and you should find the long discussion.

Cheers,
--Colin

These were great slides.  Are all you POCs going to move to field trial and then production? I know AT&T?s w/r to controller and virtualization are moving in that direction.

Also are you planning on contributing applications (like policy engine) back into ODL?

I am noticing a lot of participation in ODL and OPNFV by the Chinese companies.
Maybe ODL/LF should invest in a company to translate the documents into Chinese.

Liang Ou might be able to answer your question whether all POC will move to field trial and production.

It is a great idea to translate ODL documentation, especially user guide and dev guide into Chinese, SDN.Lab did some translations of ODL documents, I will talk to them and see if we can do something to streamline this work.

George

These were great slides.  Are all you POCs going to move to field trial and then production? I know AT&T?s w/r to controller and virtualization are moving in that direction.

-        We do try to move POC to field trial. But the progress is uncertain because we need more VNFs besides vBNG to support service chaining, most current VNFs are poor at performance. BTW, we already have several field trials for vBRAS in some metro networks. But those are vendor?s proprietary controller instead of OLD. Prushing vendors to move those controllers to ODL is another choice for us.

Also are you planning on contributing applications (like policy engine) back into ODL?

-        Yes. Actually, we are seeking a new policy engine from ODL project to replace our policy module. GBP and NEMO are under evaluation, how to simplify abstraction concepts to end user in above two projects is headache problem for us.

I am noticing a lot of participation in ODL and OPNFV by the Chinese companies.

Maybe ODL/LF should invest in a company to translate the documents into Chinese.

-        As far as I know, some Chinese tech websites start translation work as mentioned by George. But language is not the biggest obstacle, use cases on how to apply ODL in different solutions are more important in current phrase.



BR,



Liang Ou

Hi Margaret,

 

Liang Ou might be able to answer your question whether all POC will move to field trial and production.

 

It is a great idea to translate ODL documentation, especially user guide and dev guide into Chinese, SDN.Lab did some translations of ODL documents, I will talk to them and see if we can do something to streamline this work.

 

Thanks,

George

Notes on how often to upgrade:

* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade

When it comes to fleshing out current plugins, I think different PTLs are
approach things differently. That being said, my suggestion is to send
e-mails to the relevant lists either referring to a new feature or a
documented bug/issue. Some (really most) projects track new features as
bugs with the severity set to ""enhancement"".

After the e-mail,
1.) make sure the bugfix and/or new feature actually appears on the release
plan for the project
2.) make sure to actually try it out during the development cycle to make
sure it's doing what you expected

For projects with waning interest, the right approach is obviously going to
depend on the project and situation. It never hurts to let people know that
you're actually using it and explaining how so that the developers know
what they're doing matters. That being said, it might not be enough if
there are business concerns that shift attention.one way or another. You
can mitigate that by trying to make sure more than one vendor is
significantly involved in things, but I know that's not always easy.

Specific to Boron, it sounds like there's a few asks here:

a.) Try to connect users into the per-project feature request and
development during the release cycle. This is a great idea, but at the very
least will take time and cycles from users to engage and make sure things
actually happen. Also,

b.) You'd like to see Add-Path support in the BPG project.

c.) You'd like to see some NETCONF changes. Are these more or less the same
ones that we had the previous thread about?

Almost two months ago, we had an advisory group meeting about Boron planning and requirements. As part of that I agreed to try to send out a mail asking for more input from the AG on Boron, but failed to do so until now.
Here are my quick notes with full notes below.

Critical Priority:
* Easier upgrades/migration between versions. This includes the ability to do skip upgrades (Helium => Beryllium) rather than having to go through each incremental release (Helium => Lithium => Beryllium).

* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade
    * every six months seems crazy for operators if it's a critical component

Subject: [advisory-group] Boron Planning

Almost two months ago, we had an advisory group meeting about Boron planning and requirements. As part of that I agreed to try to send out a mail asking for more input from the AG on Boron, but failed to do so until now.
Here are my quick notes with full notes below.

Critical Priority:
* Easier upgrades/migration between versions. This includes the ability to do skip upgrades (Helium => Beryllium) rather than having to go through each incremental release (Helium => Lithium => Beryllium).
High Priority:
* Documentation
* Compatibility information (mostly w.r.t. hardware)
Other ideas (from the AG):
* More focus on TSDR, collection of logs, alarms, analytics, etc.
* Change control, e.g., Microsoft's statesman
* Dealing with conflicting commands going to devices
* Not really a development idea, but dealing with what should go in ODL vs. being solved elsewhere
    * especially in the context of VNFM vs. controller vs. NFVO
    * Margaret argues that if the controller controls it?the controller should also do it's lifecycle management

--Colin

More raw notes:
Still more topics/ideas:
* Should we have shorter release cycles (less than every 6 months)
* Should we think about offering different support timelines? SLAs for support?

Notes on how often to upgrade:
* upgrade every other seems more common than on every release
* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade
    * every six months seems crazy for operators if it's a critical component
* comcast just moved off of Essex for openstack (released early 2012)
* AT&T says six month cadence is about right
    * If you're forced to upgrade A => B => C vs. A => C that changes some of how
* Beau says that LTSes seem less relevant, people upgrade when they need new features not on a cadence

Let me first to wish you a happy new year,
Yes P4 is an interesting technology with an objective to go beyond Openflow with a complete programmable network protocol 'the 4th P in P4 is for any protocol.
who is able to present us P4 ? Or maybe we can ask one of P4 leader to give us a overview on P4. Anyway in case we think it's an important technology, who is interested to initiate such project within ODL?

Subject: [advisory-group] Boron Planning

Almost two months ago, we had an advisory group meeting about Boron planning and requirements. As part of that I agreed to try to send out a mail asking for more input from the AG on Boron, but failed to do so until now.
Here are my quick notes with full notes below.

Critical Priority:
* Easier upgrades/migration between versions. This includes the ability to do skip upgrades (Helium => Beryllium) rather than having to go through each incremental release (Helium => Lithium => Beryllium).
High Priority:
* Documentation
* Compatibility information (mostly w.r.t. hardware)
Other ideas (from the AG):
* More focus on TSDR, collection of logs, alarms, analytics, etc.
* Change control, e.g., Microsoft's statesman
* Dealing with conflicting commands going to devices
* Not really a development idea, but dealing with what should go in ODL vs. being solved elsewhere
    * especially in the context of VNFM vs. controller vs. NFVO
    * Margaret argues that if the controller controls it?the controller should also do it's lifecycle management

--Colin

More raw notes:
Still more topics/ideas:
* Should we have shorter release cycles (less than every 6 months)
* Should we think about offering different support timelines? SLAs for support?

Notes on how often to upgrade:
* upgrade every other seems more common than on every release
* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade
    * every six months seems crazy for operators if it's a critical component
* comcast just moved off of Essex for openstack (released early 2012)
* AT&T says six month cadence is about right
    * If you're forced to upgrade A => B => C vs. A => C that changes some of how
* Beau says that LTSes seem less relevant, people upgrade when they need new features not on a cadence

Dear all
Let me first to wish you a happy new year,
Yes P4 is an interesting technology with an objective to go beyond Openflow with a complete programmable network protocol 'the 4th P in P4 is for any protocol.
who is able to present us P4 ? Or maybe we can ask one of P4 leader to give us a overview on P4. Anyway in case we think it's an important technology, who is interested to initiate such project within ODL?

Dear all
Let me first to wish you a happy new year,
Yes P4 is an interesting technology with an objective to go beyond Openflow with a complete programmable network protocol 'the 4th P in P4 is for any protocol.
who is able to present us P4 ? Or maybe we can ask one of P4 leader to give us a overview on P4. Anyway in case we think it's an important technology, who is interested to initiate such project within ODL?

Subject: [advisory-group] Boron Planning

Almost two months ago, we had an advisory group meeting about Boron planning and requirements. As part of that I agreed to try to send out a mail asking for more input from the AG on Boron, but failed to do so until now.
Here are my quick notes with full notes below.

Critical Priority:
* Easier upgrades/migration between versions. This includes the ability to do skip upgrades (Helium => Beryllium) rather than having to go through each incremental release (Helium => Lithium => Beryllium).
High Priority:
* Documentation
* Compatibility information (mostly w.r.t. hardware)
Other ideas (from the AG):
* More focus on TSDR, collection of logs, alarms, analytics, etc.
* Change control, e.g., Microsoft's statesman
* Dealing with conflicting commands going to devices
* Not really a development idea, but dealing with what should go in ODL vs. being solved elsewhere
    * especially in the context of VNFM vs. controller vs. NFVO
    * Margaret argues that if the controller controls it?the controller should also do it's lifecycle management

--Colin

More raw notes:
Still more topics/ideas:
* Should we have shorter release cycles (less than every 6 months)
* Should we think about offering different support timelines? SLAs for support?

Notes on how often to upgrade:
* upgrade every other seems more common than on every release
* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade
    * every six months seems crazy for operators if it's a critical component
* comcast just moved off of Essex for openstack (released early 2012)
* AT&T says six month cadence is about right
    * If you're forced to upgrade A => B => C vs. A => C that changes some of how
* Beau says that LTSes seem less relevant, people upgrade when they need new features not on a cadence

Sounds good. Is anyone else working with P4? I might have something from Comcast too by then.

I guess from Colin's questions he (and perhaps other developers) would like to see more information on how we would use P4, and what the interaction model between a controller and a P4 switch might look like. Do we want a controller to worry about loading P4 program blobs? Or just interacting with the P4 program already on a switch?

Asunto: Re: [advisory-group] Boron Planning

Dear all
Let me first to wish you a happy new year,
Yes P4 is an interesting technology with an objective to go beyond Openflow with a complete programmable network protocol 'the 4th P in P4 is for any protocol.
who is able to present us P4 ? Or maybe we can ask one of P4 leader to give us a overview on P4. Anyway in case we think it's an important technology, who is interested to initiate such project within ODL?

Cordialement

So, I'll admit my ignorance of the low-level details of P4. What is the runtime programming interface to a box supporting P4? Is there an analog of flowmods? Is it specified somewhere?

I was just going to say the same thing Chris said. What is the use case which pulls an SDN controller with P4?
If P4 is the new version of Openflow, then I guess we should have an adapter to the equipment supporting P4.

P4 should be somewhere I think. Which leads me to realize I don?t know what interaction ODL has with P4 currently.. is there any?

Subject: [advisory-group] Boron Planning

Almost two months ago, we had an advisory group meeting about Boron planning and requirements. As part of that I agreed to try to send out a mail asking for more input from the AG on Boron, but failed to do so until now.
Here are my quick notes with full notes below.

Critical Priority:
* Easier upgrades/migration between versions. This includes the ability to do skip upgrades (Helium => Beryllium) rather than having to go through each incremental release (Helium => Lithium => Beryllium).
High Priority:
* Documentation
* Compatibility information (mostly w.r.t. hardware)
Other ideas (from the AG):
* More focus on TSDR, collection of logs, alarms, analytics, etc.
* Change control, e.g., Microsoft's statesman
* Dealing with conflicting commands going to devices
* Not really a development idea, but dealing with what should go in ODL vs. being solved elsewhere
    * especially in the context of VNFM vs. controller vs. NFVO
    * Margaret argues that if the controller controls it?the controller should also do it's lifecycle management

--Colin

More raw notes:
Still more topics/ideas:
* Should we have shorter release cycles (less than every 6 months)
* Should we think about offering different support timelines? SLAs for support?

Notes on how often to upgrade:
* upgrade every other seems more common than on every release
* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade
    * every six months seems crazy for operators if it's a critical component
* comcast just moved off of Essex for openstack (released early 2012)
* AT&T says six month cadence is about right
    * If you're forced to upgrade A => B => C vs. A => C that changes some of how
* Beau says that LTSes seem less relevant, people upgrade when they need new features not on a cadence

Today we are issuing the second *OpenDaylight User Survey* to collect data
on where, why and how people are using ODL. We?ll use data from both
surveys to show deployment and adoption trends, and have added several new
questions to increase our understanding of demographics and usage.

We are asking our advisors to please take the survey, circulate internally,
and share with others.

Our previous survey findings were very well received by reporters and the
industry at large, so we anticipate similar levels of interest as we
continue to show trends.

Full results will be shared privately with AG and ODL members prior to a
results summary being published, which will happen in tandem with the
Beryllium launch.


Let us know if you have questions. Thank you!

Currently as Director of Global Network Architecture, in addition of being the Architect for the External infrastructure (Internet and Extranet), he leads the emerging technologies, (NSV/NFV) Network Service/Function Virtualization, and (SDN) Software Define Networking Programs.

Carlos has been the Network Architect for the Click-to-Compute private cloud project from its inception, overseeing the entire design, automation of network Services, and creation of Network self-service offerings for LBaaS, FWaaS, etc. He was also part of the group who designed the Next generation data center, next generation firewall, NG monitoring projects among many others.

While taking  a leave from Fidelity to later return,  he worked as a Chief Architect as part of the Divx Professional Services group,  consulting, designing, and deploying  video over IP and Content Delivery Networks for Fortune 100 Companies.
Prior to Fidelity Carlos worked for The Venezuelan Revenue Service,  and Verizon Wireless as Chief Internal Auditor among other positions.

Hi Chris,

Next scheduled AG meeting is on March 17th, I would expect a lot of people will be attending ONS. Do you think we can have a room to do f2f meeting or that is too much.

Thanks,
George

Hi Chris,

Next scheduled AG meeting is on March 17th, I would expect a lot of people will be attending ONS. Do you think we can have a room to do f2f meeting or that is too much.

Thanks to Sameer Patel and Jason Schnitzer for presenting their work at
Comcast with ODL and the PCMM plugin originally created by Cable Labs.

During the presentation, we walked through the observations/questions that
this team had while developing their Demos/PoCs that is attached as a word
document to this email.

I forwarded these materials yesterday to a couple of the lead developers
within OpenDaylight and the MD-SAL project.  Their responses are below.
For follow up, I suggest that Sameer and Jason start a thread on either the
controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org or the
mdsal-dev at lists.opendaylight.org email list referencing their original
observations and the responses provided thus far by Colin and Robert.  From
there a more specific dialog can take place for each of the topics.

Best,

Phil.

Hey Robert and Colin:

Comcast is presenting at the ODL Advisory Group tomorrow morning.  Along
with the slides they are presenting, I also receive a word document (both
attached) with observations/questions they are asking with regard to ODL
MD-SAL features/capabilities... particularly in the context of how they see
the MD-SAL being used by the PCMM plugin developed by CableLabs.

It would be great to have answers and suggested-paths-forward for these
guys during the call tomorrow morning.  Would you be able to provide me
with answers to the questions/observations in the attached word doc. and
even better, be able to attend the Advisory Group meeting tomorrow morning
(PDT time)?

Meeting Logistics are:
Unless otherwise noted regular meetings are held at 8:00am Pacific Time,
11:00am Eastern Time, on the third Thursday of each month.

1.) In order to get transactional behavior from the northbound you need to
either (a) write to the config data store and then poll the operational
data store until it looks the way you'd expect, which is what it sounds
like they're doing or (b) implement an RPC and call that to accomplish your
transaction, which might better suit their needs.

2.) I think you can do an update. Usually this is by doing a PUT to a lower
point in the data tree to only change what you need. This can also be
accomplished using the Java data store API of merge to leave other parts
untouched, which is a bit more powerful. I'm pretty sure we also added
support for HTTP PATCH, which should allow similar things.

3.) We support this via Notifications. The are exposed NB from OpenDaylight
over WebSockets.

4.) It is true that right now our data store replication is not pipelined,
which means that the throughput for transactions is 1/latency to another
instance. This is something we are aware of and could be fixed. In the
short-run, if you batch more ""operations"" into each transaction, this
should help mitigate the negative impact of the limit.

5.) Our logging definitely leaves something to be desired at times. We have
logging best practices [0], but they aren't always followed and likely
aren't complete. Improving this is an ongoing effort in which we'd love
help.

Agreed, PCEP already does this: the RPC call does not return until the
network element acks it.

NETCONF operations, being a pass-through data store access, always
operate synchronously.

Yup, MERGE is the operation they want, and RESTCONF PATCH allows them to
do that -- committed in Boron and Beryllium SR2.

Also, data store operations are driven via ""notifications"" -- depends on
what exactly is they want to listen for.

This a multi-faceted question:
- memory efficiency suffers when replicated, but PCMM probably does not
care. Tracked as a requirement from BGP, post-Boron (BUG-5718 is a
prerequisite)
- transaction pipelining *will* be fixed in Boron, BUG-5419
- switching masters is pretty much a ""restart apps"" thing (at least
judging by the code, not sure what the operational experience is),
BUG-5280, will be fixed in Boron
- adding a node should not have a large-scale impact

For testing -- Vratko is currently designing the test suite, IIRC.

I?ve entered some feedback/wish list into the BGPCEP project mailing list that covers things we would like to see wrt clustering for BGP-LS and PCEP.

A few notes on BGP HA clustering.


1.       BGP-LS/ BGP

a.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.

                                                               i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.

                                                             ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.

                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector

b.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.

                                                               i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors

                                                             ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.

2.       PCEP

a.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.

b.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.

c.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.

One of the possible selling points in an HA setup would be EASE of configuration. Currently there are several ways of hiding HA setups in routers. They depend protocols below (i.e. HSRP,etc. ). However, they tend to be cumbersome because you need to have multiple, synchronised copies of RIB residing in all possible speakers, so that any of them can take over in case of failure of the active one. This is not AFI but protocol specific?

If we are able to provide a clean solution that is easy to understand, I know a couple of people who would be quite happy.

Then I would also like us to understand the implications of using BMP data in our apps. It is extremely tempting, but I?m sure we will face (positive) feedback loops with more than just probable oscillation danger. I think we may be in a good position to discuss guidelines to avoid nasty things like this. Any incident might be quite devastating for our

A few notes on BGP HA clustering.


1.       BGP-LS/ BGP

a.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.

                                                                  i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.

                                                                 ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.

                                                               iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector

b.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.

                                                                  i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors

                                                                 ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.

2.       PCEP

a.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.

b.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.

c.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.

ODL has created a Trademark Working Group (TWG) to discuss if/how to modify

Our key questions for you are:

1) Are these three designations meaningful to you as an end user; why/why
not? What would be most meaningful?

2) If you are a service provider, would you consider using the ""ODL

1) Are these three designations meaningful to you as an end user; why/why not? What would be most meaningful?

2) If you are a service provider, would you consider using the ""ODL powered"" badge to market your own solutions?

Feel free to reply directly to me or to the group. We appreciate your input. Holler with questions. Thanks!

Hi folks,

Thanks for reminding, Luke. The thing is that our PCEP people are excited about any prospect of PCEP activities in ODL? I talked to then and the question what WHEN?

Did you get any feedback on the feasibility of the suggestions?

I guess in the PCEP case you?re talking about something like keepalived moving the active IP between nodes. I don?t see ODL doing that, but then we?ll need a way to make sure what keepalived thinks is true is in face true. Also, can?t we have PCE initiated PCEP sessions? Or am I imagining that?

A few notes on BGP HA clustering.


1.       BGP-LS/ BGP

a.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.

                                                                              i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.

                                                                            ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.

                                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector

b.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.

                                                                              i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors

                                                                            ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.

2.       PCEP

a.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.

b.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.

c.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.

OK, my pet topic!!! ?

One of the possible selling points in an HA setup would be EASE of configuration. Currently there are several ways of hiding HA setups in routers. They depend protocols below (i.e. HSRP,etc. ). However, they tend to be cumbersome because you need to have multiple, synchronised copies of RIB residing in all possible speakers, so that any of them can take over in case of failure of the active one. This is not AFI but protocol specific?

If we are able to provide a clean solution that is easy to understand, I know a couple of people who would be quite happy.

Then I would also like us to understand the implications of using BMP data in our apps. It is extremely tempting, but I?m sure we will face (positive) feedback loops with more than just probable oscillation danger. I think we may be in a good position to discuss guidelines to avoid nasty things like this. Any incident might be quite devastating for our

We might have a weird case because we have existing tunnels that we delegate to the controller and its only on a split/merge to create new longer latency paths for more capacity around an outage that we need to create/delete tunnels.

We also fallback to distributed if the controller is down ?

I don?t know if Pedro has run into this but we are using  PCEP to update tunnels but when we want to create tunnels the options that we want to set aren?t available in the PCEP standard so we have to use the CLI/Netconf to create the tunnel and then PCEP to update bandwidth and tunnel path.
We might have a weird case because we have existing tunnels that we delegate to the controller and its only on a split/merge to create new longer latency paths for more capacity around an outage that we need to create/delete tunnels.

We also fallback to distributed if the controller is down ?

Hi folks,

Thanks for reminding, Luke. The thing is that our PCEP people are excited about any prospect of PCEP activities in ODL? I talked to then and the question what WHEN?

Did you get any feedback on the feasibility of the suggestions?

I guess in the PCEP case you?re talking about something like keepalived moving the active IP between nodes. I don?t see ODL doing that, but then we?ll need a way to make sure what keepalived thinks is true is in face true. Also, can?t we have PCE initiated PCEP sessions? Or am I imagining that?

A few notes on BGP HA clustering.


1.       BGP-LS/ BGP

a.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.

                                                                              i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.

                                                                            ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.

                                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector

b.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.

                                                                              i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors

                                                                            ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.

2.       PCEP

a.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.

b.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.

c.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.

OK, my pet topic!!! ?

One of the possible selling points in an HA setup would be EASE of configuration. Currently there are several ways of hiding HA setups in routers. They depend protocols below (i.e. HSRP,etc. ). However, they tend to be cumbersome because you need to have multiple, synchronised copies of RIB residing in all possible speakers, so that any of them can take over in case of failure of the active one. This is not AFI but protocol specific?

If we are able to provide a clean solution that is easy to understand, I know a couple of people who would be quite happy.

Then I would also like us to understand the implications of using BMP data in our apps. It is extremely tempting, but I?m sure we will face (positive) feedback loops with more than just probable oscillation danger. I think we may be in a good position to discuss guidelines to avoid nasty things like this. Any incident might be quite devastating for our

Not sure we need 3 designations but for adaptors and applications it would be good to have a program that suppliers could use to be ?certified?

I cant say. We have used logo?s when it makes sense in technical presentations but overall I think our PR folks are conservative on those things.

AG members:

ODL has created a Trademark Working Group (TWG) to discuss if/how to modify our trademark policy to include ""badges"" that can be used by vendors/providers. The purpose is twofold:

1) A signal to end users that ""badged"" products meet certain technical requirements they may be seeking.

2) Allow vendors/providers to display their commitment to the ODL platform, and raise their industry profile by marketing their badges to end users.

OpenStack's badge system models most closely what we've been discussing, if that is familiar to you. There is consensus that the TWG would like an ""ODL powered"" designation now, and an ""ODL compatible"" designation down the road as the ecosystem grows. We are also discussing pros/cons of an ""ODL distribution"" designation. See the attached doc for details.

Our key questions for you are:

1) Are these three designations meaningful to you as an end user; why/why not? What would be most meaningful?

2) If you are a service provider, would you consider using the ""ODL powered"" badge to market your own solutions?

Feel free to reply directly to me or to the group. We appreciate your input. Holler with questions. Thanks!

The ""ODL certified"" descriptor is great and as a term is well
recognized/understood.

Badges would be elective not mandatory unless folks feel strongly
otherwise. We did discuss that to get badge(s) one should be a member. That
is a common requirement for these programs. Or we could offer a discounted
rate for members versus non members (also common).

Regarding having both ""powered"" and ""distro"", most are suggesting just
powered.

Jamil, in your last note what you describe is a distro whereas the
""powered"" designation is simpler by design to include just MD-SAL and
Controller as the core components. This provides basic interoperability
while allowing vendors to develop on top/around as Vesko stated.

Thank you for the input so far.

The ""ODL certified"" descriptor is great and as a term is well recognized/understood.

Badges would be elective not mandatory unless folks feel strongly otherwise. We did discuss that to get badge(s) one should be a member. That is a common requirement for these programs. Or we could offer a discounted rate for members versus non members (also common).

Regarding having both ""powered"" and ""distro"", most are suggesting just powered.

Jamil, in your last note what you describe is a distro whereas the ""powered"" designation is simpler by design to include just MD-SAL and Controller as the core components. This provides basic interoperability while allowing vendors to develop on top/around as Vesko stated.

Other thoughts/comments welcome, we appreciate it.

Thinking of the TWG is that we would pursue ""powered"" now, and
""compatible/certified"" further down the road, perhaps 18 months or more as
the ecosystem grows.

Does this group see compatible and certified as two distinct programs or
could they be one that encompasses apps, hardware etc? Would love thoughts
here. (The latter was where we were leaning.)

	The Spectrometer team is following up on the query around portability of stats gathering/etc?
referred to in the URL below for the context.    I believe that we have addressed the issue of
portability in our forthcoming release, but we are following up here just to be sure.  Please

At the last Advisory Group meeting I took the action item to kick off a
discussion thread on the idea of creating an Edge Computing effort similar
to what the ONOS project has done with CORD.

We briefly talked about this at the last Advisory Group meeting and I would
like to solicit further thoughts from you on this topic if possible.
Please feel free to respond with any comments you may have.  For me, the
leading questions I would like your thoughts on include:

- What ""flavors"" of CORD are most interesting to you?  I believe that
someone on the past AG call noted that M-CORD was interesting and it had
significant similarity to the Mobile Edge Computing  effort (
http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/mobile-edge-computing).
What is everyone's thought on that?  Are there others and what priority
order should we consider?

- Where are the most likely homes for such and effort and what are the
pros/cons of each?  OPNFV is a logical contender.  Are there others?

- Are there other Open Source groups beyond OPNFV that we should target?

- Any other questions you may have.

Please let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.

Best,

Phil.

Due to key conflicts and travels, missed some recent meetings.  I have some quick thoughts to share here doe discussion?

*       We can call it SDEN ? software defined edge networking/node. 

*       ODL is the network controller for SDEN, to state the obvious ?:)

*       ODL to develop APP (as Service/APP controller) for the SDEN use cases

*       ODL to interface with Open-O perhaps other applicable Open Source Orchestration for Telco SDEN service use cases

 

Use cases wise, I suspect Residential CO would see early and more deployments opportunities.  I believe it is also easier to get (ODL community) started. Second would come to the Analytic SDEN, again it is relatively playing into ODL current strength. IoT SDEN is also a good one for ODL, I suspect some developers would already jump in?

Hello ODL Advisory Group members:

 

At the last Advisory Group meeting I took the action item to kick off a discussion thread on the idea of creating an Edge Computing effort similar to what the ONOS project has done with CORD.

 

 

We briefly talked about this at the last Advisory Group meeting and I would like to solicit further thoughts from you on this topic if possible.  Please feel free to respond with any comments you may have.  For me, the leading questions I would like your thoughts on include:

 

- What ""flavors"" of CORD are most interesting to you?  I believe that someone on the past AG call noted that M-CORD was interesting and it had significant similarity to the Mobile Edge Computing  effort (http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/mobile-edge-computing).  What is everyone's thought on that?  Are there others and what priority order should we consider?

 

- Where are the most likely homes for such and effort and what are the pros/cons of each?  OPNFV is a logical contender.  Are there others?

 

- Are there other Open Source groups beyond OPNFV that we should target?

 

- Any other questions you may have.

 

Please let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.

 

Best,

 

Phil.

Interesting discussion , agree with Alex for SDEN.
In m-cord the ONOS SDN controller and XoS orchestrator are use to control the virtualization function for core and access (vEPC, vBBU ) and mobile edge computing servers.
Mobile edge computing can be considered as cloud openstack solution to deliver compute , storage/cache... to improve mobile services like better latency.
In m-cord , as ONOS the main interface si OF, we don't have a control for the Radio part RRH.
In Opendaylight as its a multi interface controller  we a have now a new radio projects called OCP to implement control and management plan for ORI interface between BBU and RRH.
I think this OCP project is very important and we can position ODL as a controller for 5G CRAN radio access. ODL can also manage the mobile edge computing based on openstack.
I have seen that Foxconn is behind this project and I am interested to have more information about the rational.
Phill, Neela, it's possible to have a presentation on OCP project during our next advisory meeting?
I have ask internally , in Orange , our position on OCP.

For us its E-CORD and A-CORD. We're looking at E-CORD architecture in particular to solve some of our WAN networking business challenges (cost and agility challenges primarily - ie, the usual).

We are doing some research and experimentation with the M-CORD concept for use at T-Mobile.  So far this has been using the published CORD infrastructure based on ONOS, XOS.  However, ONOS and XOS are currently not the Controller/Orchestrator of choice so we are hoping to see if another Controller/Orchestrator pair can be substituted or, at the very least, be controlled via API from our current choice.

I think it would be very helpful to the acceptance of OpenDaylight if we could develop a similar CORD example that can be used.

Subject: [advisory-group] Edge Computing Use Cases (similar to CORD activities) using OpenDaylight

Hello ODL Advisory Group members:

At the last Advisory Group meeting I took the action item to kick off a discussion thread on the idea of creating an Edge Computing effort similar to what the ONOS project has done with CORD.

We briefly talked about this at the last Advisory Group meeting and I would like to solicit further thoughts from you on this topic if possible.  Please feel free to respond with any comments you may have.  For me, the leading questions I would like your thoughts on include:

- What ""flavors"" of CORD are most interesting to you?  I believe that someone on the past AG call noted that M-CORD was interesting and it had significant similarity to the Mobile Edge Computing  effort (http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/mobile-edge-computing).  What is everyone's thought on that?  Are there others and what priority order should we consider?

- Where are the most likely homes for such and effort and what are the pros/cons of each?  OPNFV is a logical contender.  Are there others?

- Are there other Open Source groups beyond OPNFV that we should target?

- Any other questions you may have.

Please let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.

Best,

Phil.

I think much have been said already, but I agree that M-CORD like functionality should be the highest priority. That being said,  E- and R- is of interest as well.

As for Mobile Edge Computing, isn?t that since some time ago based out of the Open Edge Computing (OEC)? Same people, wider scope?
OPNFV definitely seems like a perfect fit, and here?s the presentation on OEC from the recent Summit in Berlin: https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/EVNT/Berlin+Design+Summit+Schedule?preview=%2F6824840%2F6824831%2F2016-06-21+Open+Edge+Computing+-+published+final.pdf

To me, this looks like a good opportunity for ODL and I will check thoughts on this internally as well.

Sorry to ask but does anyone know what is the SDN controller exact role(s) in the reference architectures provided by Edge Computing initiatives like FOG/MEC/OEC?

Also depending on the role, controller will have to support different set of APIs, so are these or other Edge Computing initiatives already working in standardizing these APIs?

Short version is that Honeycomb is an ODL module that makes use of the auto-generated Java bindings to the binary API of VPP. It aims to produce semantically meaningful abstractions for the dataplane mechanisms; not exposing too much of the internal workings but enough to retain the flexibility it offers. The intention is that you could strip ODL down to the bare essentials and use that as a lean agent on a packet forwarding device. It has some way to go but it is progressing quite well.

Thanks to Clyde for presenting our training efforts at this morning's
meeting and for the excellent input the Advisory Group members had
participating on the call.

Clyde asked that I forward the note below.  As those on the call know, we
are looking for feedback on the existing course and your suggestions on
what course material would be most useful to your organizations in the next
6 to 18 months.  Please let us know your thoughts!

See everybody at the ODL Summit!

Hi Phil,

Thanks again for arranging for me to connect to the group this morning. I
don't have access to everyone's email from the invite so could you please
distribute?

Link to the free survey course (range of cloud technologies, including but
not limited to SDN): Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure
<https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-cloud-infrastructure-linuxfoundationx-lfs151-x>

Link to the paid introductory course: SDN Fundamentals
<https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/software-defined-networking-fundamentals>,
use this coupon code to check out at no cost: SDNreview (made this good for
20 so folks can share with team members)

Look forward to getting some more detailed feedback on how to make this one
better.

Regards

Clyde

I agree, based on our use-cases and implementations, reality might differ from the technical report.

Now that ODL supports RFC7432 it should also minimally include:

?         EVPN route table testing

?         Mass withdrawals

?         Convergence (MAC Mobility)


I was also wondering about performance metrics when running multiple services concurrently. i.e. impacts on scale when running BGP and OVSDB/Openflow concurrently.

Regards,

Daniel Bernier

At the ODL Summit there was a discussion of input/requirements to the performance testing group. We thought that the advisory group might actually be a good source for where we would want to run automated load/scale testing of ODL. Perhaps some common use cases that the different applications needed to understand better.

I took an action item to start the discussion.

I'm polling to find out if people prefer we:


-          Try to schedule for the week after.

-          Skip the February call; the next one would be the usual date in March.

I suspect trying to schedule for the week before is less likely to succeed since that would be next week; though feel free to indicate this or any other preference.

Please reply to the list or to me; will collate the responses before the end of the week.

Tomorrows agenda is light but we've never had a problem finding things to talk about! We'll ask the TSC for an update and then we can have an open discussion.

One hot topic that has come up is SD-WAN. I'd like see if anyone who has been working on SD-WAN would be willing to talk tomorrow, and perhaps present more fully later. Phil is curious whether people are looking at commercial solutions involving ODL in this space and I am curious how people are stitching the moving parts together.

Sounds like a very interesting discussion on the positioning of ODL for SD-WAN. Not to precede that discussion, but I think the bigger play for ODL is always going to be vCPE/uCPE use-case. We will probably have 20 different opinions on what the difference in definition is.
Especially considering you ought to look at a ""uCPE"" as a distributed single-tenant (customer) NFVI - and then start to question what the difference to vCPE is in every other regard than different NFVI tiers. Also, with that in mind, there's nothing stopping you from combining the deployment scenarios that originally were labelled separately as SD-WAN, vCPE and uCPE.

Supposedly, and at least according to our marketing department, we were the first operator in Europe to onboard a customer onto an SD-WAN platform just a few days ago via our Finnish OpCo - Sonera:

Hello, everyone!

This is just a reminder that this month's Advisory Group call is tomorrow at 8am PST, Olivier Augizeau from Orange will talk about their transition from an IP/MPLS backbone to SDN. Would anyone else like to offer their feedback on their transition efforts or offer insight as to why they decided to forgo a migration. There will also be an opportunity to discuss the ramifications of migration.

Chris will also reserve 10 minutes to discuss agenda topics for May.

Best,
Casey

maybe one of the topics that could be discussed next month is
repeatibility. As part of my post-Telefonica life, I'm currently teaching
an ODL lab. I decided to use stable/Boron-SR2 for repeatibility. Before the
Easter break, I could generate all the sub files for my projects flawlessly
with mvn archetype. But as of yesterday, it stopped working. It complains
about the default-cli target not being supported.

Problem is the lab is today (Aamof in a couple of hours) :-(

I don't mind (and I even expect) this happening on a development branch,
but I think it should not happen in a stable branch (otherwise, why call it
stable?). Can this be a topic for next month's telco?

Talk2U soon, /Pedro A. Aranda

Casey noticed that the next scheduled AG meeting falls on top of the Beijing OPNFV summit and suggested we move the AG meeting to avoid it. I propose we push it back one week to the following Thursday.

If nobody objects before the end of Monday next week then that's what we'll do.  (Perhaps let me know if that window is too short; I just want to try to action it before it's forgotten!)

Thanks,
Chris.

At the ODL Advisory Group meeting this today the question came up about ONAP upgrades and the work with Karaf4 in Nitrogen.

Do you have a set of requirements on upgrade that the community is assuming like making it easy for Service Providers and their developers to do the upgrade of production data and upgrade of their application code to work with Nitrogen ?

We cancelled todays call for light attendance; likely everyone is on vacation!

For the September 21st call, we have these topics in mind:


  *   Ahead of the DDF meeting in October, what features and stability improvements are end users looking to see in OpenDaylight? Feel free to discuss on-list, but we'll also make time at the next AG call. Current topics can be found at the wiki: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Events:Oxygen_Dev_Forum
  *   Several large changes are upcoming in OpenDaylight which may have significant impact to existing installations of ODL, including in the Karaf 4 and Yang projects. We should discuss ways in which these sorts of changes can be communicated to end users, not least to minimize surprise when they do land.

Cheers,
Chris

a development infrastructure. I'm on Carbon-SR1 and when I follow the
instructions on the WIKI (see screenshot) I receive the same error (see log
for better legibility) I did just before the crisis. Obviously the docs
have to change. Now I have the recipe for
Boron :

#!/bin/bash

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.opendaylight.controller
-DarchetypeArtifactId=opendaylight-startup-archetype \
-DarchetypeCatalog=remote \
-DarchetypeVersion=1.2.2-Boron-SR2

However, I have not succeeded in finding the archetypeVersion for
Carbon-SR1.

If someone can tell me what the right versions are, I could give the WIKI a
try and correct the whole procedure.

Best, /PA

PS: I have received a couple of comments from people facing this very issue
and for many it is a showstopper in using ODL. How can they recommend ODL
if the docs are wrong in something as fundamental as this? And I hate to
have to agree with them...

I asked Casey if we could have a summary of the DDF which was held this week. He also suggested these topics that ODL would like feedback on:


*         Ask for feedback on stable/experimental features, and breaking up the ODL distribution to a more core release with core features.

*         What might be the next ""carrier grade"" feature to work on besides In Service Software Upgrades (ISSUs) and what HA metric or scale metric to drive for?

As always, if anyone has other topics please let us know.

I'd like to find out why attendance on the monthly AG calls has dropped over the last few months.


  *   Is it something simple: The invitation is no longer in your calendar?
  *   Is the timing too inconvenient? (The current time is obviously unkind to our Asian colleagues)
  *   Is the discussion not relevant enough?
  *   Or are you perhaps no longer involved or interested with OpenDaylight?
  *   Too busy and it was the thing that dropped?

And finally, what changes might help increase your participation? What topics or areas of discussion are important to you?

Thanks,
Chris.

Hi Chris,

As member of the ODL tech community, I was always interested in attending this call and get feedback from ODL users but the time never worked for me.

For my part I still believe in the value of the advisory-group but I have been taken by other industry involvement surrounding ODL (FD.io<http://FD.io>, ONAP, OPNFV) which makes my attendance a bit more difficult (e.g. ""Death by Meetings"" https://www.amazon.com/Death-Meeting-Leadership-Business-Lencioni-ebook/dp/B008L03W7O)

For myself, i will start introducing a proxy when I am not available

Hello, Advisory members.

The OpenDaylight technical community is seeking feedback regarding the  
distribution of OpenDaylight.

We ask that you complete this poll to help OpenDaylight determine how it  
should distribute OpenDaylight in the future.  There is a discussion on  
releasing a &quot;Core&quot; distribution that may not include all features  
commonly included in the distribution. Other artifacts considered unstable  
would be available as a separate download.  The questions are designed to  
determine how they may affect your Organizations and if you would find  
value in this style of Distribution.

Thank you,
Casey

Sorry I cannot join today as this is the last day f SC17
and we have a 3 Tbps Networks for Science
multicontroller and high throughput
setup we are demonstrating.

I need to say that after updating to Carbon our Dell Z9100-ON and
S6100-ON switches would not work and so we were obliged to fall back to 
Boron SR4.

What I think is lacking in the release procedure is an in-depth
validation process on all major switch/routers and their various
firmware releases. This would server to verify that the ODL release is 
fully functioning, OR
to identify problems on each switch/firmware combination so that they
can be dealt with - by the switch vendor or by the ODL community.

We wanted to let you know that we are hosting an open meeting of User
Advisory Groups at ONS. It will be a F2F meeting only (no telephone bridge)
and we are extending the invitation to the ODL EUAG, OPNFV EUAG, LFN member
representatives, and other service provider companies.

Now that we have established LF Networking, we'd like to talk to the
operator community about how to evolve the OPNFV EUAG and ODL EUAG going
forward, how to engage with more of the projects within LFN, and to ensure
that we have a strong end user voice in the work of LFN.

This meeting will take place Wednesday, March 28, 2:30 - 3:50 PM in the
KTown Room (across from the business center on the 5th floor on the ONS
venue). If you're going to be present at ONS, we hope that you will attend
this session to give us your views. If you will not be present, but you
will have colleagues in attendance at ONS, please forward this invitation
on them. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks!

Here is my suggestion.

Multi-site clustering using non-voting member provides baseline support for geo-redundant operation but there are limitations both in the degree of automated failover and the performance impacts of large MD-SAL datastore replication during return to service operations.

As more and more applications include micro-service components the interaction of micro-services with MD-SAL and MD-SAL clustering becomes an important design consideration.

What is the roadmap for clustering and in particular geo-redundant operation ?
What is the roadmap for MD-SAL ?
Are there plans for support of micro-services and or broader support for containers as part of ODL ?

Reminder, there will be an AG call today on the topic of clustering in ODL. I've had confirmation that at least one developer will be able to attend to participate.

Brian gave us some talking points to start with; more discussion obviously welcome:

Multi-site clustering using non-voting member provides baseline support for geo-redundant operation but there are limitations both in the degree of automated failover and the performance impacts of large MD-SAL datastore replication during return to service operations.

As more and more applications include micro-service components the interaction of micro-services with MD-SAL and MD-SAL clustering becomes an important design consideration.

What is the roadmap for clustering and in particular geo-redundant operation ?
What is the roadmap for MD-SAL ?
Are there plans for support of micro-services and or broader support for containers as part of ODL ?

Cheers,
Chris.

347,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/,advisory-group,message,[advisory-group] Announcing the LFN End User Advisory Group,"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 05:49:09 -0700",kpaul at linuxfoundation.org (Kenny Paul),<8B6E32B0-D143-44C5-B01E-4601DF41CE58@linuxfoundation.org>,"Members of the ODL Advisory Group,

As you are no doubt aware, the harmonization that LF Networking is enabling is resulting in alignments in a number of areas.  One of these comes in the form of a new LFN End User Advisory Group which was recently given the go-ahead by the Governing Board.   There was an open meeting at ONS in Las Angeles to discuss the focus and composition of the new organization. The wiki page (still under development) and minutes from that initial meeting can be found here: 
LFN End User Advisory Group (EUAG) <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2916362>

Comprised of members such as telecommunications carriers, cable operators, network, application, compute or storage service providers who are responsible for the implementation, deployment and support of LFN solutions, the Charter <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/download/attachments/2916362/LFN%20EUAG%20Charter%204-13-2018.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1523664238000&api=v2> of the LFN-EUAG includes among other things :
Strategy and long term planning of feature and functionality alignment across LFN Projects
The identification of functional and/or operational concerns which are inhibiting the adoption of LFN solutions
Architectures and technical requirements that serve these business areas 
Providing end user perspectives on value and usability of LFN technology
Areas of focus to address short term business requirements
Project testing environments, test cases, and/or Proof of Concepts
Membership eligibility is based upon an individuals job role within an end-user organization and is capped at no more than three individuals from the same company at this time. Membership in the Linux Foundation is not a requirement. The LFN-EUAG operates in purely advisory capacity and will subsume any of the Project specific advisory groups which may have previously existed. 

There are no limits on the total number of members at this time, however consideration will be first given to those currently serving on one of the existing Advisory Groups.

If you would like to become a member,  please review the End User Advisory Group Charter <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/download/attachments/2916362/LFN%20EUAG%20Charter%204-13-2018.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1523664238000&api=v2> and the End User Advisory Group Membership Agreement <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/download/attachments/2916362/LFN%20EUAG-Agreement%204-13-2018.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1523664218000&api=v2>. Questions and signed agreements should be sent to euag-info at lists.lfnetworking.org <mailto:euag-info at lists.lfnetworking.org> 

Please reach out directly if you have any questions.
