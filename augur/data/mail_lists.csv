could assume all servers can be configured to present an IRD with more than
one Network Map. Otherwise we will need different test setups, and two
different classes of servers.

So would anyone object to requiring servers to present multiple Network
Maps?

2. Clients should be able to cope with an IRD with multiple Network Maps,
but the RFC does not require them to be able to use anything other than the
default network.One way to handle that is to define two sets of client
tests: one which uses the default network map (and requires the client to
use the cost maps for the default map, rather than a cost map for a
different network), and an optional set that uses a secondary network map.

3. The RFC allows IRD chaining ? a root IRD can reference secondary IRDs
with additional resources. Should we require servers to support that
feature?

I have no problem with this requirement.

This setting is also fine with me.

Do you mean that the server root IRD must include at least an IRD resource?
I feel that this should be optional. If really required, I assume that the
server can post a second level IRD that points to a subset at the same
server, unless we want to test a case of using IRD chaining to
use different ALTO servers.

Hi Xin,


By ""anyxml"" in the YANG Model, the content of the xml data file can by arbitrary. If there is no necessity in using the anyxml statement, I would try to avoid it as much as possible and actually model the data. If it is strictly necessary, then you might need to parse that part of the xml file on your own.

Best,
Xiao

Dear Varga and others in yangtools,

I am working at implementing alto in odl and i use anyxml to define some data in yang model considering the data could be an object, array, string, etc. But i find that there is no method to set its value in the class generated by using yang tools, also there is no field of the data in the class. There is no error when generating the code. It looks like it just skips the anyxml defined data. Did i miss something to make it work? Or it doesn?t support anyxml for now?

Thanks,
Xin

number, but calendar is an array. This was a highly debated feature in the
alto protocol design, and the choice of JSONValue is the final outcome,
given that alto is based on json. A client can figure out the the type from
the cost-type associated with each cost map. I assume that augment based on
the type maybe one way, but we do not know about the DOM. We will take a
look right away. Any quick pointer?

Thanks a lot!

Here are some key design issues and the lead (please read and be prepared
to lead):

1. ALTO (provision) manager design (Shu and Kai: please lead the design
review). Please give us the complete CI spec (since it runs in karaf,
consistent with karaf ci style makes senses to me), if possible, and then
the implementation structure. If you can write up a bit in the user guide,
it will be so cool (goto https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/ALTO:Main and
you will see the link to user guide, and this should be under admin). The
current version is my placeholder. Please feel free to modify.

2. Auto map (need a better name). Xin W. please lead.

3. Northbound (Kai please lead).

4. IRD generation (Kai please lead).

We will progress according to the proceeding, but limit the meeting to 1.5
hours max. Hence we may not be able to cover all items.

Hi,

We do not support anyxml in currently generated DTOs, but DOM data and DOM broker support it using different

APIs (called DOM APIs).

 

Which type of data from alto specification do you want to model as anyxml?

 

 

Tony

Dear Varga and others in yangtools,


 


I am working at implementing alto in odl and i use anyxml to define some data in yang model considering the data could be an object, array, string, etc. But i find that there is no method to set its value in the class generated by using yang tools, also there is no field of the data in the class. There is no error when generating the code. It looks like it just skips the anyxml defined data. Did i miss something to make it work? Or it doesn?t support anyxml for now?


 


Thanks,


Xin

Subject: [yangtools-dev] Anyxml in yang model

Dear Varga and others in yangtools,

I am working at implementing alto in odl and i use anyxml to define some data in yang model considering the data could be an object, array, string, etc. But i find that there is no method to set its value in the class generated by using yang tools, also there is no field of the data in the class. There is no error when generating the code. It looks like it just skips the anyxml defined data. Did i miss something to make it work? Or it doesn?t support anyxml for now?

Thanks,
Xin

1. The design is to be consistent with karaf commandline.
2. karaf access can be remote (
http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/remote.html). Hence, we
need to consider how an admin can edit,  upload, and download resource
files.
3. An admin may need to upload a set of resources. Hence, how this is
accomplished (automation, scripts) should be considered.
4. The admin ci should support both upload, download but also set control
options.

 Hi All,

We?re facing issues in automated system test that it seems the remote Karaf
command does not take multiple arguments and complained ?too many arguments
specified?. On the same test bed, manually executing the same command that
takes a few arguments worked fine. However, if we issue the command through
remote connection to the Karaf, then we hit the issue.

Just wondering if anyone has tried remote Karaf command and if the multiple
arguments work well through Karaf remote connection?

Thanks very much,

YuLing

Hi Yuling,
When issuing ?tsdr:list  InterfaceMetrics ?04/15/2015 15:00:00? ?04/15/2015
16:00:00? command *remotely* got the error as ?Error executing the command

Its blocking my issue integration test automation execution. Can you pls me
look in to this.

How to connect Karaf remotely:
Step 1:  ssh-keygen -t dsa -f karaf.id_dsa -N karaf
Step 2:  sshpass  -p karaf ssh  -p 8101 karaf.id_dsa.pub

(bundle, dev, feature, instance, jaas, log, obr, scr, service, shell, ssh,

idea of introducing alto as a karaf command scope may not make sense--after

believe that this design was my fault :-(

interface for an admin to load, unload, and set configs of ALTO services.
Let's still call this interface the alto-manager. For maximum flexibility,
alto-manager should not be designed to have to run inside of the same karaf
container hosting the server aspect. It should be a client. Hence, it can
be a simple, standard-alone restconf client, or better, a wrapper of a
restconf client. Make sense?

A deployment scenario through the command line:

When feature alto-service is installed:

|karaf $ alto:service <service-name> <operation> [<parameters>]
service-name = { ird-pool | networkmap-pool | costmap-pool | endpointmap-pool }
operation = service-operation

service-operation = { start | stop | autostart { true | false } | status }

instance-pool-operation = {
      list
    | create <id> <description-file>
    | destroy <id>
    | start <id>
    | stop <id>
    | autostart <id> { true | false }
    | status <id> [<version-tag>]
    | update <id> <new-description-file>
    | configure <id> <property> [<parameters>] }
|

When no parameters are given to configure the command will return the
value of
the property.

|ird-registry-operation = {
      register <resource-id> { remote <ird-registry-uri> | local <ird-id> }
    | unregister <resource-id> { remote <ird-registry-uri> | local <ird-id> }}
|

When |ird-pool| service is activated:

|karaf $ alto:ird <operation> [<parameters>]
operation = instance-pool-operation | ird-registry-operation
|

When |networkmap-pool| service is activated:

|karaf $ alto:networkmap <operation> [<parameters>]
operation = instance-pool-operation | ird-registry-operation
|

When |costmap-pool| service is activated:

|karaf $ alto:costmap <operation> [<parameters>]
operation = instance-pool-operation | ird-registry-operation
|

When |endpointmap-pool| service is activated:

|karaf $ alto:endpointmap <operation> [<parameters>]
operation = instance-pool-operation | ird-registry-operation
|

Here are some examples for the description files:
A static networkmap description file example:

|{
    name : ""static-map-1"",
    generator : {
        class : ""static-file-generator"",
        file : ""/opt/alto/configuration/networkmap/static-map-04542ead1343.map""
    }
}
|

A host tracker costmap description file example:

|{
    name : ""hosttrack-map-singleton"",
    generator : {
        class : ""hosttracker-generator"",
        dependency: [
            ""static-map-1"",
        ]
    },
    autostart : true,
    registry : [
        ""remote:http://someoneelse.com/ird/registry"",
        ""local:root-ird"",
    ]
}
|

The yang-models for ird-pool service and data are described in the
attached files (still not complete though).

Yours,

K

The backgroud is though cost has multiple structures like string, list, etc, for one provider, the type of cost should be static, which means for example, alto-xxx provides one and just one type of cost, cost-xxx, at the same time alto-yyy provides another one and only one type of cost, cost-yyy. Any provider provides only one type. And if it provides cost, then it should use augment statement to add new cost type.


This still has limitations considering when using restconf to get value, it should specify the cost type instead of getting any type of cost.


Does this make sense?


Thanks,

Xin

- My understanding is that your :service command is to decide if a category

- Instead of :x commands, how about instanceop

- A key flexibility you are considering, I believe, is ird.

- The commands map to old projects.

 This is a lot of flexibility, which is quite interesting. An alternative
is that the CLI deletes the related data instance (e.g., network map).
Hence, the benefit of your design is that it might be more efficient:
instead of delete a network map and then reload, you stop and then restart.
One question is how often this happens. But I like the idea of applying it
to Xin's auto map. Consider future extension, then such auto generators
need to stop running. It needs some kind of interface to stop in a
consistent way. Make sense?

I don?t get it. If we don?t use them as karaf commands in ODL, why
bother implementing CLI in ODL?

Also the CLI is just a northbound tool, it justs take the parameters,
maybe validates them and invokes the corresponding service to do the
job. It?s just for administrative convenience after all. The CLI doesn?t
actually do anything about the services themselves and in some way they
are also clients to the services. And yes of course they can be made
standalone and be named whatever people want.

The design for CLI syntax has nothing to do with the functionalities of
the services. The reason I write down the details of the syntax is to
demonstrate what functionalities should be supported by the services.

And since it is brought up, certainly the CLI tool can be configured to
connect a remote server. In karaf, I imagine it is possible to implement
that with subshell so things will look like:

|karaf $ alto-cli:connect <server-uri>
karaf(alto-cli) $ networkmap list
karaf(alto-cli) $ networkmap status default-networkmap
|

The idea is simple. All alto services can run independently. It is
possible to run networkmap services without running an IRD service.

Setting autostart to true means the service should be activated once the
controller is up.

Why stop a service: when you don?t want to run such a service. For
example I have one controller running both networkmap/costmap services
then one day I decide to use the networkmap from a standalone server I
can just turn off my networkmap service and configure my costmap service
to use that networkmap.

Why make it harder than it has to be? |alto:ird register| is so much
better than |alto:instanceop ird register| in my opinion.

Not actually. The only reason I provide the yang models for IRD alone is
that IRD is the simplest service among all.

I wouldn?t worry about it. Changing the scope such as ?alto-cli? can
simply do the trick. And if the subshell is confirmed then there will be
no confusion.

Hi Xin,
Good discussion. Suppose the admin issues alto:delete (btw, I found the verb destroy too violent, so I, as you, will use delete). I assume that then the network will disappear. This means that it should not appear either in northbound or restconf (deleted from data store). Following the principle of minimal amount of work, then your bundle should deregister from all events and stop running. We do not have a restart command yet---we have not designed the whole life cycle thing yet. So the state machine, at this point is:
event: feature:install -> state: runningevent: alto:delete hostrackermap -> state: stopped
There is no transition to resurrect it, unless we want to conduct a more complete lifecycle design. 
The outcome of the admin issues feature:install again at the stopped state is not defined.
Agree?

Richard Yang),<CANUuoLqx3AtDVXV2Gqw1Fim0DRZJGa8sOtuA2qnsi4XqB1+Pkg@mail.gmail.com>," to plan a bit for the next week. In particular, there is
the ODL training for the whole week next week, which means that Kai and
Wang Xi will be busy learning more on ODL. This is great for the long term.
Here is more proposal for next week:

1. Basic goal: finish T1 to T6 (see slack test channel).

2. Start to conduct code review (both Wendy and I are eager to read the
design).

3. Start to systematically add unit and system tests

4. Start to plan to add new things:
   Topology (path vector)
   Demonstrate the use with an ALTO client: in particular GridFTP, or
MapReduce (Hadoop or Spark).

The highest priority is to finish 1. To make sure that we accomplish this
item, we need a scheduler/champion to monitor tasks and issues of this
item. I am wondering if there is one person who can take on this role. Or
we can do distributed computing: there is a champion for each of T1 to T6.
Ideally, the champion is the person who takes on the major missing piece of
each Ti. Please let me know. If no response, I will make a proposal.

Thank you so much!

Richard

Let me understand. What is a goal of defining a default cost field? Or you
are suggesting that there is a default cost field, say numerical, and then
use augment to change (or add) it into another type, when it is, say,
ordinal? My understanding is that augment can only add (
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020#section-7.15).

For efficient storage, in terms of Java classes, I feel that a possible
definition of a cost-map is the following:

Inner level is from string (dst pid name) to the type such as a float
(numerical) or int (ordinal) or vector (path-vector): HashMap<String,
Integer> or HashMap<String, Double> or HashMap<String, Vector>, ..

Outer level is a hash map from string (src pidname) to the inner level
hashmap, e.g.,
HashMap<String, HashMap<String, ValueType>>

A very dumb inheritance based design is is:
class CostMapBase {
  // base field (meta)
}

class CostMapInt extends CostMapBase {
  HashMap<String, Integer> costmap;
}

class CostMapDouble extends CostMapBase {
  HashMap<String, Double> costmap;
}

Or if one uses the containment design:
class CostMap<ValueType> {
  // meta
 HashMap<String, HashMap<String, ValueType>> costmap;
}

I believe that the augment mapping is based on inheritance. Hence, to
simulate the first design, the augment defines the whole hashmap of
hashmap. Make sense?

Let me summarize the option, if we use yang (BTW: I always think using yang
is a wrong design decision, because it does not add much free ride but add
much restriction, at least for a programmer, :-(

Here is the proposal: Base cost-map includes only meta; depends on
cost-metric, we add (augment) the correct hash map. This is to simulate the
inheritance design in my previous email (base class has only meta and each
derived class has the correct HashMap of HashMap; note there is a typo in
the previous email, which I fixed in this reply). I will take a look at
Jackson to see how it handles such stateful parsing.

I thought about a yang storage model where each cost value is always a
float (this is allowed by the Java promotion rule), but it is a hack that
will fall apart when we add vector.

Thanks.

Richard Yang),<CANUuoLr1NQpQWDdtvb7p5EusMpPWMWPqHA9iJOQE=g8WxsnO5w@mail.gmail.com>,"ht was that we would define new entity body providers to parse
and serialize alto media types:
https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/message-body-workers.html

In reading the current design
(alto/alto-northbound/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/alto/northbound), I
saw that we are parsing a string, e.g.,
    @Path(""/filtered/networkmap/{id}"")
    @POST
    @Consumes({ MediaType.ALTO_NETWORKMAP_FILTER})
    @Produces({ MediaType.ALTO_NETWORKMAP, MediaType.ALTO_ERROR})
    public Response retrieveFilteredNetworkMap(
            @PathParam(""id"") String id, String filterJSON) {
    ...
    NetworkMap.Filter filter = mapper.asNetworkMapFilter(filterJSON);
...

I am not an expert of jax-rs, and I am actually fine with parsing the body
as a String. This seems to imply scanning the msg body twice: first to
convert to a strng and the scan it, but the msg body is small anyway.

My question is: how is the conversion from body to the string happened (
https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/message-body-workers.html#providers-selection).
Is the MessageBodyReader<T>/MessageBodyWriter<T> design considered ()?

Let me start by saying that the current design is very clean. Great work!

Here is some more thinking:
- Jackson has three methods to process JSON (data binding, tree, and
streaming: http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonInFiveMinutes). The cleanest is
definitely data binding, which is the current design.

- An unknown type in RFC7285 is cost map. As we discussed in previous
email, it can be
Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>
or
Map<String, Map<String, Double>>
depending on the cost-mode. Later, it may become an array...

The current design is the following
(alto/alto-commons/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/alto/commons/types/rfc7285/CostMap.java):
    @JsonProperty(""meta"")
    public Meta meta;

    @JsonProperty(""cost-map"")
    public Map<String, Map<String, Object>> map
                        = new LinkedHashMap<String, Map<String, Object>>();

This is a clever design using Object.

One question: I have not tested the code. Given that the northbound writing
is public String asJSON(Object obj) throws Exception {
        return mapper.writeValueAsString(obj);
    }

Is it RFC7285 compliant (i.e., output int or double for cost map)?

Suppose we do want the more specific type (e.g., some cost being int and
some being double is not allowed), so that Object is changed to a specific
ValueType, then generic binding may not work, and we will need to use the
streaming parser:

  JsonFactory f = new JsonFactory();
  JsonParser jp = f.createJsonParser(json);
  // skip to first sub object -- **need to assume that the first is meta
though**
  Meta meta = mapper.readValue(jp, Meta.class);
  // look into the cost mode in meta and decide the ValueType;
  // map is a pointer to the specific types
  if (""numerical"".equals(meta.costType.mode))
    // one branch
  else if
    // another branch
  ...

I am not proposing the preceding change yet, but it may help to give
comments on the design choices--for example, the choice of map of map to
Object instead of specific int or double.

Make sense?

Hi Shu,


Let's schedule a design meeting soon. It depends on when Xin and Kai are available.


Xin/Kai: please let us know.


Let me summarize the option, if we use yang (BTW: I always think using yang is a wrong design decision, because it does not add much free ride but add much restriction, at least for a programmer, :-(


Here is the proposal: Base cost-map includes only meta; depends on cost-metric, we add (augment) the correct hash map. This is to simulate the inheritance design in my previous email (base class has only meta and each derived class has the correct HashMap of HashMap; note there is a typo in the previous email, which I fixed in this reply). I will take a look at Jackson to see how it handles such stateful parsing.


I thought about a yang storage model where each cost value is always a float (this is allowed by the Java promotion rule), but it is a hack that will fall apart when we add vector.


Thanks.


Richard

Actually I don't have a solution for the default cost field problem but the intuition told me that we should set a default cost field in alto-model instead of leave it as empty. I think your design is very good, but I have no idea how to implement it by yang. Do you think it's necessary to schedule a meeting to discuss it together?

Actually I posted my progress in slack but it seems that no one was on it, so I will post it here:


Most of the alto-manager code has been done during the last weekend. The code review link: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/18601 . However, the code logic for cost map and endpoint property map is not done yet since currently alto-commons does not support converting from rfc cost-map/endpoint property-map json to the one with yang model encoding, and vice versa (which means it only supports network-map now). Since kai is busy this week, I wrote the converter for the cost-map yesterday by myself but have not tested and pushed the code. I'm expecting to finish the endpoint property map part tonight.


Great!
 
After that I will finalize alto-manger and then help with @xinli to write the test cases with robot framework. I'm expecting to finished all the test cases related to alto-manager this week.
 
Thanks. 
 
Also, I had a long offline discussions with @xinwang about cost field of cost map. Things become a little complicated when it comes to cost field of cost map. If we use augmentation for cost field, alto-commons will depend on the project where the augmentation defined to convert cost-map json string to proper java object, that is to say, here, alto-commons is depending on alto-hosttracker. So could anyone code review and approve the code @xinwang just pushed last weekend so we could use his code?


I will review tomorrow.

 
Also, although using the augmentation, i think defining a default cost field in alto-model is necessary. Currently what we did is just deleting the field from alto-model and defining it in some other projects by augmentation.


Let me understand. What is a goal of defining a default cost field? Or you are suggesting that there is a default cost field, say numerical, and then use augment to change (or add) it into another type, when it is, say, ordinal? My understanding is that augment can only add (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020#section-7.15). 


For efficient storage, in terms of Java classes, I feel that a possible definition of a cost-map is the following:


Inner level is from string (dst pid name) to the type such as a float (numerical) or int (ordinal) or vector (path-vector): HashMap<String, Integer> or HashMap<String, Double> or HashMap<String, Vector>, ..


Outer level is a hash map from string (src pidname) to the inner level hashmap, e.g.,
HashMap<String, HashMap<String, ValueType>>


A very dumb inheritance based design is is:
class CostMapBase {
  // base field (meta)
}


class CostMapInt extends CostMapBase {
  HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Integer>> costmap;
}


class CostMapDouble extends CostMapBase {
  HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Double>> costmap;
}



Or if one uses the containment design:
class CostMap<ValueType> {
  // meta
 HashMap<String, HashMap<String, ValueType>> costmap;
}


I believe that the augment mapping is based on inheritance. Hence, to simulate the first design, the augment defines the whole hashmap of hashmap. Make se"

The easiest way to implement ECS is for the server to map each endpoint to a pid and return the costs between the pids. But the server  MAY use more detailed cost information if it wants.

Does that help?

Fewer judgement, fewer jumpes and simplified, consistent code,Make sense.
There are similar something in file named RpcRegistryBuilder.java under alto-provider/??../modules/module/configuration/alto/provider/impl

2:  File named ?YangModuleInfoImpl? line36 there are duplicated something between $YangModuleInfoImpl method(line 30 to line 33) and getModuleSourceStream.YangModuleInfoImpl can call getModuleSourceStream to get a stream.

    private $YangModuleInfoImpl() {
        Set<YangModuleInfo> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(org.opendaylight.yang.gen.v1.urn.opendaylight.params.xml.ns.yang.controller.md.sal.binding.rev131028.$YangModuleInfoImpl.getInstance());
        set.add(org.opendaylight.yang.gen.v1.urn.opendaylight.params.xml.ns.yang.controller.config.rev130405.$YangModuleInfoImpl.getInstance());
        set.add(org.opendaylight.yang.gen.v1.urn.ietf.params.xml.ns.yang.rpc.context.rev130617.$YangModuleInfoImpl.getInstance());
        importedModules = ImmutableSet.copyOf(set);

        //InputStream stream = $YangModuleInfoImpl.class.getResourceAsStream(resourcePath);
        //if (stream == null) {
        //    throw new IllegalStateException(""Resource '"" + resourcePath + ""' is missing"");
        //}
        InputStream stream = getModuleSourceStream ();// new added one
        try {
            stream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
        // Resource leak, but there is nothing we can do
        }
}

The processing code in RFC2ModelEndpointAddressGroupCoventer.java seems only could cope with most one IPV4 and(or) one IPV6.

    @Override
    protected Object _convert() {
        List<ModelEndpointAddressGroup> out = new LinkedList<ModelEndpointAddressGroup>();
        if ((in().ipv4 != null) && (!in().ipv4.isEmpty())) {

            out.add(v6);

It is reseanable that one EP has multiple IPV4 addresses or multiple IPV6 addresses.

Did I misunderstand something .

We appreciate your interest of ALTO and the effort to improve its performance.

For the record, however, the code are generated by yangtools automatically. A patch is still welcomed but I think you can report this to the yangtools group so that these issues can be solved, at least from my perspective of view, in a more general and elegant manner.

Thanks again for your work and we are glad to get feedback from the community.

Fewer judgement, fewer jumpes and simplified, consistent code,Make sense.
There are similar something in file named RpcRegistryBuilder.java under alto-provider/??../modules/module/configuration/alto/provider/impl

in().ipv4 is a list, so is in().ipv6.

Hi  folks,
I am suspecting there are some constraints on AddressGroup which could most include one IPV4 and(or) one IPV6. The processing code in RFC2ModelEndpointAddressGroupCoventer.java seems only could cope with most one IPV4 and(or) one IPV6.

    @Override
    protected Object _convert() {
        List<ModelEndpointAddressGroup> out = new LinkedList<ModelEndpointAddressGroup>();
        if ((in().ipv4 != null) && (!in().ipv4.isEmpty())) {

It is reseanable that one EP has multiple IPV4 addresses or multiple IPV6 addresses.

Did I misunderstand something .

Good proposal. I?ll try to find who is responsible for that.

Mr. Chen,

We appreciate your interest of ALTO and the effort to improve its performance.

For the record, however, the code are generated by yangtools automatically. A patch is still welcomed but I think you can report this to the yangtools group so that these issues can be solved, at least from my perspective of view, in a more general and elegant manner.

Thanks again for your work and we are glad to get feedback from the community.

Yours,

Hi Kai,

Good proposal. I?ll try to find who is responsible for that.
There is another project(https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/YANG_Tools:Main), may be the committers know the clue.

Mr. Chen,

We appreciate your interest of ALTO and the effort to improve its performance.

For the record, however, the code are generated by yangtools automatically. A patch is still welcomed but I think you can report this to the yangtools group so that these issues can be solved, at least from my perspective of view, in a more general and elegant manner.

Thanks again for your work and we are glad to get feedback from the community.

Yours,

GK

it!

Tomorrow (May 14) is the M5 cutoff date. As project leads (PL), Kai/Shu
will need to send an email to the release mailing list to report M5 status.
If you do not subscribe to the release mailing list, you may not have seen
others' email. I can forward an email to you in this case.

I wonder if the PL think we should have a sync up meeting tomorrow morning
US ET (say 8:30 am ET, which is 8:30 pm China), to resolve last-minute
issues. I am available at the said time.

Thank you so much!

After the CoNEXT we may get back to alto-0.2.0, and I?d like to share
some thoughts on the components
and the corresponding functionalities.

 1.

    alto-core: The service abstractions and the road map to all ALTO
    instances.

      * alto-model: a new YANG model for ALTO services
      * alto-provider: declares ALTO service and provides some general
        functionalities such as identifier (resource id,
        endpoint id, etc.) management
 2.

    alto-basic: basic functionalities and helper functions/components

      * alto-simple-XXX: simple implementation of ALTO services:
        manually configurable network/cost map,
        network/cost map-based ecs/eps/filtered map/ird
      * alto-cli: karaf command line tool for alto-simple-xxx
      * alto-northbound: exploit ALTO service in RFC7285-format
      * ?

    p.s. Lots of functionalities can be imported from palto.

 3.

    alto-extension: automatically generated, high-performance,
    enterprise-oriented ALTO services

      * hosttracker-based networkmap/costmap/ecs/eps
      * bgp-based networkmap/costmap/ecs/eps
      * ?
 4.

    alto-applications: some other extra features that are based on ALTO

      * ?

We may discuss the details and make plans for future development later.

Hi all,    

I?m going to write the documentation of ALTO within two or three days and we would be ready for M5.

deployment. In particular, my understanding of the proposal is that the
interop should leave as much unspecified as possible. A first reaction then
is how to validate the correctness. For example, the response of
resource-id is not known ahead of time. I assume that then the interop
participants will need a second channel (e.g., human in the loop) to verify
that a client c1 gets the correct response from a server s1. Is this the
intended setting?

2. A second comment is that it will be interesting if the interop design
will also become a starting point of ALTO compliance tests. We partition
the tests into MUST and optional so that a test case is a MUST case if and
only if (iff) it is a MUST in RFC7285. In the current proposal below, I see
some mix (e.g., some services in the interop is not a MUST in RFC7285).
Make sense?

This makes sense. We can specify the validation condition for the interop:

- For network map, the only unspecified value then is the ""vtag"" field, and
the interop specifies the assert, which is based on consistency between
data and IRD.

- For cost map, the only unspecified is the exact ""dependent-vtags"", and
your validation makes sense.

This is a reasonable validation. An issue is that RFC7285 specifies only
that ""An ALTO server MUST support at least one of the following modes:
 numerical and ordinal."" I believe that RFC7285 chose to not specify the
consistency between the two modes. Hence, this is beyond compliance, right?
Hence, I feel that separating RFC7285-conforming and beyond can be helpful.

2. A second comment is that it will be interesting if the interop design
will also become a starting point of ALTO compliance tests. We partition the

if (iff) it is a MUST in RFC7285. In the current proposal below, I see some
mix (e.g., some services in the interop is not a MUST in RFC7285). Make
sense?

would have added that if I realized it wasn't there.

But if we take off our lawyer hats, and look at RFC 7285 as an agreement
between friends, rather than a formal contract between adversaries, then I
think it is reasonable to say that if the ordinal mode costs do not preserve
the order of the numerical costs, then that server is wrong.

Similarly, a router is allowed to drop packets, and I do not think there is
any formal requirement that it cannot drop *every* packet. So theoretically
you could glue eight jacks to a block of hardwood and market it as a router.
Maybe you could avoid getting charged for fraud. Just don't expect anyone to
buy more than one! :-)

And looking at it from a real-world perspective, the whole concept is
irrelevant. The only reason for defining ordinal mode is to allow a server
to hide the numerical costs. For example, if the numerical costs to three
PIDs are 10, 11 and 100, a client can deduce that the middle pid is close.
If the costs are 10, 99 and 100, a client can deduce that the middle pid is
distant. If the ordinal costs are 1,2,3, a client cannot deduce anything
other than 1 is better than 2 is better than 3.

So if a server offers numerical costs, there is no advantage for it to also
offer ordinal mode costs.

And if numerical costs are available, there is no advantage to a client to
use ordinal costs. Maybe if the client could assume the ordinal costs are
1,2,3,? -- but the client cannot.

So in practice, no server will offer both numerical & ordinal mode for the
same metric.

That means a formal compliance test should only require one mode or the
other, but not both. However, keep the interop simple, unless someone
objects, I suggest we require both modes.

Hi Everyone,

A few folks have pinged me about this so I thought I'd send out an email.
I've spent most of my day working out and submitting patches for building a
successful Lithium RC0 and projects have been pretty quick at responding so
far.

Unfortunately I'm now blocked on moving forward with an Alto patch that
needs to be merged [1]. Alto's Karaf bundle's is pulling down the Beryllium
release of Controller's karaf-parent. Of course this does not exist in
Lithium so the build is failing and unable to find that artifact. I hope
the Alto project can merge this patch soon so we can make more progress on
getting an RC0 out asap.

Regards,

Thanh

I remembered that the removal of the consistency requirement was a
conscious decision, not an omission, to reduce the load of consistency
checking. I buy your point below of a server supporting only one, in the
sense of providing the maximum allowed by the privacy concern.

Regarding supporting both in the interop, I will be happy to wait a bit to
hear others' opinions.

I don't think ALTO cost metrics could ever meet the requirements for a
metric space. The problems:

* A true metric d(x,y) must be defined for all x & y. ALTO does not require
that the cost be defined for all pairs.

* For a metric, d(x,y) = d(y,x) for all x,y. ALTO costs represent
communication links, and are potentially asymmetric. Eg,  the download
bandwidth can be higher than the upload bandwidth.

* For a metric, d(x,x) = 0 for all x. For ALTO, the cost within a PID
frequently is greater than 0.

* For a metric, d(x,y) = 0 means x = y. We *might* be able to define ALTO
costs so that is possible, but I have my doubts.

* For a metric, d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z) for all y. For ALTO, that is
tempting requirement, and I cannot think of an obvious counter example. But
I doubt that would help without the other requirements.

So we could not require *every* ALTO cost metric to qualify as a
mathematical metric. But we could define a particular cost as satisfying
those rules, and (say) identify it in the IRD.  Can you explain how that
would benefit clients or servers? One obvious advantage is that the cost
matrix could be smaller, because its symmetric and the center diagonal is 0.

I am pretty sure someone has actually tried to sell me one of these and can find it in the lab (but was not the purchaser).  To date its loss rate is close to 100%.  It is treated more like a very secure firewall than a router and is placed beside a tin pale that is a bit bucket someone purchased long ago. :D

On a serious note, I agree with you that only one mode would be supported on the server .   Please note that an ordinal ranking of a metric may exist if there are too many entries that have the same value in the original metric.  We do this quite often as an operator but we *always* give this metric a different name in order to emphasize the ranking aspect.

Subject: Re: [alto] Interop test

I thought RFC 7285 required order-consistency between numerical & ordinal modes for the same metric. But I cannot find that requirement. Too bad! I would have added that if I realized it wasn't there.

But if we take off our lawyer hats, and look at RFC 7285 as an agreement between friends, rather than a formal contract between adversaries, then I think it is reasonable to say that if the ordinal mode costs do not preserve the order of the numerical costs, then that server is wrong.

Similarly, a router is allowed to drop packets, and I do not think there is any formal requirement that it cannot drop *every* packet. So theoretically you could glue eight jacks to a block of hardwood and market it as a router. Maybe you could avoid getting charged for fraud. Just don't expect anyone to buy more than one! :-)

And looking at it from a real-world perspective, the whole concept is irrelevant. The only reason for defining ordinal mode is to allow a server to hide the numerical costs. For example, if the numerical costs to three PIDs are 10, 11 and 100, a client can deduce that the middle pid is close. If the costs are 10, 99 and 100, a client can deduce that the middle pid is distant. If the ordinal costs are 1,2,3, a client cannot deduce anything other than 1 is better than 2 is better than 3.

So if a server offers numerical costs, there is no advantage for it to also offer ordinal mode costs.

And if numerical costs are available, there is no advantage to a client to use ordinal costs. Maybe if the client could assume the ordinal costs are 1,2,3,... -- but the client cannot.

So in practice, no server will offer both numerical & ordinal mode for the same metric.

That means a formal compliance test should only require one mode or the other, but not both. However, keep the interop simple, unless someone objects, I suggest we require both modes.

and it can verify that ordinal cost values are consistent with the order of the known numerical values.

This is a reasonable validation. An issue is that RFC7285 specifies only that ""An ALTO server MUST support at least one of the following modes:  numerical and ordinal."" I believe that RFC7285 chose to not specify the consistency between the two modes. Hence, this is beyond compliance, right? Hence, I feel that separating RFC7285-conforming and beyond can be helpful.

Hi Everyone,

I updated the Lithium Status spreadsheet to add 2 additional tabs ""Branched"" and ""Version Bumped"" to track whether a project has branched, and if they version bumped. This should make it easier for everyone to keep updated on which projects are still waiting to be bumped or branched.

I noticed a few projects already have version bump patches submitted weren't merged because they were failing. I'll go and run rechecks on all of them now that openflowplugin has branched. Hopefully some of these projects can proceed with merging their version bump patches now.

Subject: Re: [release] version bump progress

I'm looking at this and it seems that there are two projects in a dangerous spot where they have a stable/lithium branch but have not bumped versions on their master branch:
* ALTO: please merge https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/18332/
* SDNi: please merge: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/19765/
If we could have both those patches merged, that would help.

Subject: Re: version bump progress

Hi Everyone,

I updated the Lithium Status spreadsheet to add 2 additional tabs ""Branched"" and ""Version Bumped"" to track whether a project has branched, and if they version bumped. This should make it easier for everyone to keep updated on which projects are still waiting to be bumped or branched.

I noticed a few projects already have version bump patches submitted weren't merged because they were failing. I'll go and run rechecks on all of them now that openflowplugin has branched. Hopefully some of these projects can proceed with merging their version bump patches now.

Regards,

Thanh

I agree that providing both numerical and ordinal mode for the same cost 
metric makes little sense from a real world perspective. For the 
interop, I think both should be covered. Since Wendy already proposed 
cost maps for routingcost and hopcount in her initial mail, I suggest 
providing a numerical cost map for one metric and an ordinal for the other.

I agree that providing both numerical and ordinal mode for the same cost
metric makes little sense from a real world perspective. For the interop, I
think both should be covered. Since Wendy already proposed cost maps for
routingcost and hopcount in her initial mail, I suggest providing a
numerical cost map for one metric and an ordinal for the other.

I suggest a slightly different approach: we specify the numerical values for routingcost & hopcount. Then let each server decide whether it wants to present numerical or ordinal versions. The only requirement is that a server MUST provide a routingcost cost map, either numerical or ordinal. Servers can provide whatever additional resources they want, and clients can fetch & validate any resources they recognize.

you really want to respond to a review with a new patch set on the same

Based on the assumption that 21600 was the closest to what you really
wanted I copied that and replaced the changeId so that I could resubmit it
as Patch Set 4 of 20762. Let me know if that looks wrong.

In the meantime, I'm going to assume that this is the right document to

I've fixed it in patch set 6.

My recommendation when amending a patch set is to start from the exact
patch set. You can do that by using either ""git review"" (my preference) or
by using the various download links on the top right of the gerrit link.
That should avoid introducing false dependencies.

There's information on using git review to do this here:

Ed pushed two patches to fix them that should also make it so that they're
appropriately tested on builds, checkins, etc. going forward. If you could
please merge them ASAP, it will vastly improve how the Lithium release
process goes and improve ALTO's presence in Lithium.

I saw Ed and Hideyuki uploaded 3 patches for Alto:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/alto

This issue is currently blocking the new maven plugin work for distribution offline:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/22736/

So if Alto people do not review and merge these patches by tomorrow morning PST, we will take Alto out of the Lithium integration distribution.

Hi George,

We need to reach Alto project people with urgency as we found few issues in their repository:

1) They are NOT running the SingleFeature test (thanks Ed)

2) They miss artifacts in Nexus and this is undetected because of 1)

3) When alto features are installed in Karaf, they produce these errors: https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3649

I think all the problems above would not happen if they had the SingleFeature test passing.

BR/Luis

PS- Going forward I think we will need an automation to detect when a project misses the SingleFeature test.

3) When alto features are installed in Karaf, they produce these errors: https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3649<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__bugs.opendaylight.org_show-5Fbug.cgi-3Fid-3D3649&d=AwMFAg&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=zNG2maAWRSeVFRXkY9W_6VzLFO3I_uiemceCuNsB3c0&s=jARUWvy3ASq7qqkoEnm6aNtbd6f7oDGP_B7pzXkGKec&e=>

I think all the problems above would not happen if they had the SingleFeature test passing.

BR/Luis

PS- Going forward I think we will need an automation to detect when a project misses the SingleFeature test.

Your project still haven't report RC1 test status, please do so.

Please note TSC reserve the right to drop project from Lithium release if RC1 status is not reported by 6/18  10:00 am PDT , which is just less than a couple of hours from now.

There is still one missing piece which is the ""Quality Assurance"" section

Hi all,


Since @Kai will figure out how to turn sonar on this afternoon, the others in Tongji will focus on adding more unit tests. Here is task assignments for alto members in Tongji:



1. @Jenson and @Linxiao will be responsible for adding unit tests for alto-commons and alto-extensions.
2. @Dongshu will be in charge of updating the release review and notes page and adding unit tests for alto-manager
3. @Xin wang will be responsible for adding unit tests of alto-provider and alto-hosttracker.
4. I will assgin tasks to @junzhuo once he reached the lab.


@kai Since alto-service and alto-northbound are your projects, do you want to shift some work to others or you will add unit tests for this two by yourself? 


Thanks.

implementation can then get information from different sources without
worrying about adaption issues.  I think such a standard, which
decouples the development of ALTO servers and information sources, would
be beneficial in the long run.


But private protocols can still exist for certain implementations.  
Actually they can easily extend the protocol by replacing 'type' and
'source' with some private values and filling the 'data' field in their
own format.

Kai

As July 20 will come in fast (exactly two weeks from today), I feel that it
is time for our team to get the preparation fully started. After some brief
preparation internally, we can engage on the ALTO mailing list and try to
engage more broadly.

First, the basic info:

Time: ** MONDAY, July 20th, 20:00-23:00 **

Key draft guiding the interop:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-roome-alto-interop-ietf93/

Specific tasks:

T1: Pre-testing the interop draft (Wendy has some initial tests already.)
Can some of us do a test using the ODL server? Volunteers? If no
volunteer(s) by tomorrow, I will pick.

T2: Planning the details of interop day (July 20). Any volunteers?

What else do we want to achieve/test during the interop?

Thanks a lot!

Richard

We (the chairs) organized a room (3 hours on Monday evening), and what Richard is saying (and I totally agree) is that it is a good idea to start thinking now what a ?detailed? plan could look like, in order to make the best use of the time. So any ideas / thoughts are welcome.

Dear Richard,

I can do something about Task1. Since I have not much experience in ALTO programming, I hope some one(s) with more experience can work together with me.

And about Task2, I don't learn about the details of interop, so I can't give any suggestions now.

Thanks,
Jensen

Dear all,

Sorry for the spamming. If ALTO is not your current focus, please skip this email thread :-)

As July 20 will come in fast (exactly two weeks from today), I feel that it is time for our team to get the preparation fully started. After some brief preparation internally, we can engage on the ALTO mailing list and try to engage more broadly.

First, the basic info:

Time: ** MONDAY, July 20th, 20:00-23:00 **

Key draft guiding the interop:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-roome-alto-interop-ietf93/

Specific tasks:

T1: Pre-testing the interop draft (Wendy has some initial tests already.) Can some of us do a test using the ODL server? Volunteers? If no volunteer(s) by tomorrow, I will pick.

T2: Planning the details of interop day (July 20). Any volunteers?

What else do we want to achieve/test during the interop?

Thanks a lot!

Richard

There are some ideas about the interop day:

1) We can build a web UI for presentation and visualizing the results of tests.
2) We can send out a welcome mail to others, and who want to participate the interop day can confirm this mail.
3) Shall we build a simple web site to introduce the day (The schedule and an abstract)?
...

I don't know whether these suggestions are helpful and whether these are you want. Please correct me if I have misunderstood anything.

One issue is the relationship between ALTO and SDN. I want to start this
thread not only because SDN is a hot topic or ALTO/SDN are two of my main
interests recently. More importantly, I feel that a better understanding of
ALTO and SDN can help with the future direction of ALTO. This email is not
intended to be complete, but more is to get the conversation started.

A good point of the discussion is our experiences in implementing ALTO in
OpenDaylight (ODL). A small background digression. A basic version of ALTO
has been implemented in the ODL Lithium release. We plan to participate in
the next ODL release as well, to add substantial new features, such as
incremental updates (Wendy's SSE design), routing state abstraction using
declarative equivalence, and automatic map generations. We are also
starting the integration of ALTO to ONOS soon. In you are interested in
joining such design and development, please let us know.

Now, what are some key lessons/issues that we have learned in this
ALTO/SDN?

First, a key benefit to ALTO is that it can construct its views from its
access to a centralized state of the network provided by SDN. As a basic
case, in the current ALTO/ODL implementation, the ALTO server uses
l2switch, which is a project in ODL that collects all active endhosts in
the network, to construct a dynamic network with two PIDs: internal (for
those in the network) and external (for those not). A default cost map is
constructed so that  internal <-> external has higher routing costs. As
endhosts being collected or pruned from the network state, the ALTO server
is notified by ODL's event system automatically, and ALTO's event handler
updates the network map automatically. It will be great exercise to push
this direction more, for example, by constructing more interesting,
network-state maps and endpoint cost services (ECS).

If we say the basic case is what SDN can do for ALTO, the next is what ALTO
can do for SDN. In particular, we have extended the path vector proposal
substantially to design the new ALTO service called routing state
abstraction using declarative equivalence (RSADE); see see
http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/yry/research/TechReports/GWY15.pdf
We feel that the RSADE service will be a very valuable abstraction service
for SDN.

Now, some issues and questions that have become more obvious in the process:

- ALTO maps are endhosts based, but SDN allows more fine-grained routing,
e.g., routing depending on ports. How do we handle this?

- From the beginning, ALTO's charter limits it to be a
network-state-read-only protocol. SDN allows one to ""write"" a network's
state. Suppose we have a general SDN/ALTO environment, for applications
such as large-data transfer (e.g., the multi-flow use case, big data), how
can such applications use both the ALTO channel and the SDN write channel?

Let me keep this email short and stop here, so that we may have some good
discussions, on the mailing list and/or at the Prague meeting.

Cheers,

Richard

Assume that there are several paths for data transfer computed initially at SDN controller, and path can not be set anymore after even the network becomes congested. Then applications decide how to schedule data transfer along these paths. When the result computed by applications submitted to SDN controller, the controller sets rules for these flows. Finally, ALTO server collects the current network state, and finds the cost has been updated.

However, it would become complex when the SDN controller can set new paths for applications requirements. The controller can move the data flows from the original path to the new one, or only makes new data flows transmit through new paths. Both would affect the cost in ALTO server. 

I would like to focus on this problem these days.

Imagine a centralized control plane that can coordinate the data transfers.
Applying divide-and-conquer, we can see three key modules:

M1: Endpoint (resource) selection: A receiver may have a set of candidate
senders and can choose one (or multiple and then conduct reassembly);  A
sender may have multiple receivers to choose from as well.

M2: Routing: Given a sender and a receiver, what is the path (or are the
paths) of the packets from the sender to the receiver?

M3: Rate allocation: What is the transmission rate from a sender to a
receiver? We assume no multicast.

To see how each module is implemented by network and/or by application,
consider what is network state. In a current, typical OF setting, the
network switches will have flow tables and ovsdb, which implement routing
(M2) and queueing (M3). Hence, we have the following implementation options:
M1: app
M2: net
M3: app and/or net

So far, the main focus of ALTO is on providing info from network to app for
the app to implement M1. The recent effort on path vector starts to help
providing  info from network to app for the app to implement M3.

Now, suppose SDN becomes widely used, and hence app may have an
(north-bound) API to influence M2 (e.g., a first API might be PCEP like
API). This will create control feedback, and hence a key issue for ALTO
then is what the interactions might look like. IETF does not define
algorithms but can provide guidance on the architecture.

Cheers,
Richard

Dear David, Jian,

Thank you for looking into ALTO.

In Lithium, the default costs are set essentially using a binary format. Extending it to improve flexibility is next on our agenda.

We are not running weekly meetings in these these few days due to coming IETF. I sure can answer questions. Please pick a time and we can arrange a chat. Morning ET works the best for me.

Thanks!
Richard

Hi Richard,

Jian and I are looking at Alto on behalf of Lenovo for a project and wanted to consider joining your weekly meetings.  I?m very excited about what I think Alto does.  ?

I was also hoping there was some chance you might be aware of someone who would be willing to spend about 15 minutes interactively answering questions with us.  I don?t feel experienced enough with Alto yet to feel like I?m making efficient use of the entire team emails, but can do so if/as required.

I guess one initial question was how the costs are currently set in Lithium?  We are doing the cost queries in apidoc/explorer and seeing costs that aren?t necessarily obvious.\

Thanks,

Yes. You got it.

One basic step is to make sure we get shortest path fully right. A natural
link metric is 1, and we get shortest hop count. A next step is to figure
out a natural interface, in ODL, to configure link metrics, and we compute
routing cost. A third component in ODL to conduct traffic engineering.

Let's get a couple proposals out in next week. How does this sound?

@Shu, would you please make sure everyone has subscribed the alto-dev

so we can discuss development issues here? Many thanks!

@Yichen, please figure out how to write with wiki and asciidoc (they
have much in common). You might want to subscribe to the doc mailing
list <https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/documentation> and
also download the docs project

I reckon the M1 deadline would be next week. Let?s sort things out

that the link metric is 1. Do we just implement a shortest-path algorithm
for the topology graph based on the data from *TopologyManager*?

Next step is to figure out a natural interface, in ODL, to configure link
metrics and compute routing cost. Do we design a YANG model to configure
link properties (link cost metrics)? Currently I don't see link properties
(such as delay, bandwidth) in *NodeConnector* or *TopologyUserLinkConfig. *Am
I missing anything? Do we have to design a data structure to store the cost
metric for each link?

Which version of ODL do I look into? I don't see TopologyManager code in
the Lithium release. I only see the class files. Am I missing anything?
However I see the TopologyManager in Hydrogen release.

Looking forward to your suggestions.

Thanks

a good idea that we write down the design soon so that we can all work

@Shu/Junzhuo: I believe that you are leading the ECS design. Can you write
down the discussion soon so that we can discuss with Tamim and others.

Thanks!

0,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/,alto-dev,message,[alto-dev] [alto-design] Re:  Few questions on ALTO and ONOS,2015-08-02 01:32:18,+0800,dongs2011 at gmail.com (Shu Dong),<CA+Zq8U0YWK+L=bKbpsqwnoXgLezL+5mthuTpxseQa+8QB7u3NQ@mail.gmail.com>,"to dest host first, and then compute the endpoint cost according to
the routing path and cost metric (e.g. bandwidth, hopcount).

Computing routing path in ODL is the core of the design and the details are
explained as follows:
1. We get the attachment points of source host and dest host, let's call it
start_switch and end_switch, by L2Switch.
2. We read flow table of start_switch and find the matched flow entry
according to src host IP and dst host IP. If matched flow entry is found,
we get next switch from the flow entry, then we repeat this step to chase
next switch until we get to end_switch.
4. If there is no matched flow entry, we will force ODL controller to
compute a new routing path, by either invoking the path computing function
or sending a fake packet. Once the path computing is done, we repeat step 2
until we get to end_switch.

In this way, we get the routing path. Following is the pseudo code:

>
> sw_id = get_attachment_point(src)
>
dst_sw_id = get_attachment_point(dst)

while (sw_id != dst_sw_id) {

  r <- loop_up(src, dst) in sw_id's flow table

  if (!r) {
>     forceComputeRoutingPath(src, dst)
>     r <- loop_up(src, dst) in sw_id's flow table

  }
>
  sw_id = get_sw_id(r)

}




Once we get the routing path, we can compute endpoint costs based on
different cost metrics. Hopcount is easy to compute while bandwidth is a
little more complicated since we have to get the bandwidth of each link at
first.

@Richard The following is what we have done during the past three days:
1. Get attachment point of host by host IP address. Done. (Shu, Xiao)
2. Look up flow table to get matching flow entry and next switch. Almost
Done. (Xiao, Shu)
3. Figure out how to force ODL controller to compute routing path. In
progress. (Mingming)
4. Setting up a mininet + controller test environment in our lab. (Junzhuo,
Xiao)
5. Some code refactoring. (Shu)

Things left to be done:
1. Figure out how to force ODL controller to compute routing path.
2. Figure out how to get bandwidth of each link.
3. Combine all the parts together.

>From tomorrow, we will focus on left problems. Mingming has made some
progress in the first one but it will be great if we have someone else to
help.

Thanks a lot.

From,
Shu

from it:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nx2U5WvVlCU-dierN-EF9L5iAzRrNNr1S73EzsSjAmo/edit#.
Also, there some local code changes including interop tests and the new ECS
implementation we have not pushed into ODL Gerrit but we will soon. I will
remind you when the code has been updated.

Hope it helps. Thanks a lot.

From,
Shu

addFlow at SalFlowServiceImpl). But seems the it just ad given flows to
switchers rather than calculate the path.

So I turn to OpenDayLight/controller to find a function to get the path. I
found that org.opendaylight.controller.sal.routing provides a getRoute
method but it no longer be used in the newer ODL (may be it's a AD-SAL
function). Now ODL using org.opendaylight.controller.md.sal.common.api.routing
to compute path. But I can't find out where the implement is and how to use
it. Do you have any ideas?

Thanks!

Hi Mingming,


Thanks! I haven't found the AD-SAL routing function yet and I'll continue to find it. Do you have any clues or keywords to pinpoint it? Because I can only locate the MD-SAL interfaces right now.

Hi mingming,


I'm trying to find a API to compute the link path between two hosts. So I read the code from openflowplugin (add at FlowForwarder.java and addFlow at SalFlowServiceImpl). But seems the it just ad given flows to switchers rather than calculate the path. 


So I turn to OpenDayLight/controller to find a function to get the path. I found that org.opendaylight.controller.sal.routing provides a getRoute method but it no longer be used in the newer ODL (may be it's a AD-SAL function). Now ODL using org.opendaylight.controller.md.sal.common.api.routing to compute path. But I can't find out where the implement is and how to use it. Do you have any ideas?

To clarify,  it is incomplete because it handles only the case of the
same-switch, as implied by Junzhuo's testing? So the contribution is to
handle cross-switch routing?

Hi Mingming,
I am sure there is somewhere used the Dijkstra algorithm for this. I guess l2switch is the project involving this. You can check their wiki and eventually drop a question to their mailing list. Also you can read the topology and compute by yourself.

To clarify,  it is incomplete because it handles only the case of the same-switch, as implied by Junzhuo's testing? So the contribution is to handle cross-switch routing?


Thanks.

A further question. Is there a layer 3 routing module could make OpenFlow switcher acts like a traditional router?


Thanks!
Junzhuo




Hi Evan,


It great to have your reply! I?ve seen that the method ?addBidirectionalMacToMacFlows? calls ?addMacToMacFlow? twice. Based on the code, I assume in this implementation, the STP eliminate loops so all packets can be forwarded to all switchers. So only two flow entries could build a path between two MAC addresses.


But in my test, the MAC to MAC flow only be built when two hosts connected to the same switcher. This phenomenon really confuses me. I?m looking forward to your reply.


Thanks!
Junzhuo




The Minimum Spanning Tree is calculated to prevent loops in the network, those links that receive STP blocking status won't have flows written on them. FlowWriterServiceImpl.java in l2switch-main may have what you're looking for, it can create mac to mac flows, I'm not sure how robust the functionality is at the moment.

Hi Junzhuo.
The code is here https://github.com/opendaylight/l2switch/tree/master/loopremover/implementation/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/l2switch/loopremover/topology
but I don't know if the service is working because of https://github.com/opendaylight/l2switch/blob/master/loopremover/implementation/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/l2switch/loopremover/topology/NetworkGraphService.java#L41
But I've send this email to the code's author to see what he says about it.

And the authors of l2switch also says this module is not complete. Instead, it use STP to forward all packets to every devices in the network. So we decide to develop our own module ?l2switch-plus? to enhance the ability of l2switch. As a result, we can get routing information easily.

neighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing
ECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst
pair is the same.

- As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority
flow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from
the tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that
this may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:
* We identify compression.
* Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules.
They are triggered by packet-in only.
* Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively
short timeout. Hence those rules not used by app will timeout quickly.

- In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path
to an l3 path.

In the long run, the preceding is not complete. For example, what if GBP
reroutes a flow through middle boxes. The preceding derivation based on
l2switch routing is not correct. We need to look into the composition
approach of ODL.

Subject: Re: How to compute the routing path between two hosts in OpenDayLight?

To add a bit, according to my understanding:
- current l2switch uses flooding based on a single, shared spanning. Hence, assume a switch with k neighbors in the spanning tree, it needs only k rules in its flow table: for each incoming neighbor, flood to the other k-1 neighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing ECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst pair is the same.

- As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority flow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from the tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that this may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:

* Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules. They are triggered by packet-in only.
* Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively short timeout. Hence those rules not used by app will timeout quickly.

- In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path to an l3 path.

Subject: Re: [L2switch-dev] How to compute the routing path between two hosts in OpenDayLight?

A further question. Is there a layer 3 routing module could make OpenFlow switcher acts like a traditional router?

Thanks!
Junzhuo


Hi Evan,

It great to have your reply! I?ve seen that the method ?addBidirectionalMacToMacFlows? calls ?addMacToMacFlow? twice. Based on the code, I assume in this implementation, the STP eliminate loops so all packets can be forwarded to all switchers. So only two flow entries could build a path between two MAC addresses.

But in my test, the MAC to MAC flow only be built when two hosts connected to the same switcher. This phenomenon really confuses me. I?m looking forward to your reply.

Thanks!
Junzhuo


The Minimum Spanning Tree is calculated to prevent loops in the network, those links that receive STP blocking status won't have flows written on them. FlowWriterServiceImpl.java in l2switch-main may have what you're looking for, it can create mac to mac flows, I'm not sure how robust the functionality is at the moment.

0,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/,alto-dev,message,"[alto-dev] How to compute the routing path between two hosts in
 OpenDayLight?",2015-08-09 17:57:37,+0000,ammandke at cisco.com (Amit Mandke (ammandke)),<D1ECE187.23766%ammandke@cisco.com>,"enflowplugin, controller. It seems openflowplugin just set the flow table to switchers. And controller seems no longer handle the routing calculation now
 (org.opendaylight.controller.sal.routing doesn?t exist now).

Finally I found this page(<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wiki.opendaylight.org_view_OpenDaylight-5FController-3AMD-2DSAL-3AL2-5FSwitch&d=AwMFbw&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=1Dgsyw24QLzoIhrwYfaQw2pIpT0WjsryWfiJew7gwKM&s=jcqCyDHS2n6BlBpCKMf1jFHI_VW1DdbeURlIE3s8bZI&e=>https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:L2_Switch<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wiki.opendaylight.org_view_OpenDaylight-5FController-3AMD-2DSAL-3AL2-5FSwitch&d=AwMFbw&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=1Dgsyw24QLzoIhrwYfaQw2pIpT0WjsryWfiJew7gwKM&s=jcqCyDHS2n6BlBpCKMf1jFHI_VW1DdbeURlIE3s8bZI&e=>) saids that the l2switch now provide routing service. Which module should I use and how to get the route between two hosts by existing APIs?

Thanks,

Everething works fine until step:
*Build and run ALTO in Karaf

I install a feature, for example:
*feature:install odl-alto-provider*

After that, I should be able to:
http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html
as refered: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/ALTO:Lithium_User_Guide

but I cant: ""*Unable to connect*""

When I review the feature information:















*feature:info odl-alto-provider Feature odl-alto-provider
0.2.0-SNAPSHOTDescription:  OpenDaylight :: alto :: ProviderFeature has no
configurationFeature configuration files:
etc/opendaylight/karaf/03-alto.xmlFeature depends on:  odl-alto-model

followed bundles:
mvn:org.opendaylight.alto/alto-provider/0.2.0-SNAPSHOTFeature has no
conditionals.*

and review if the bundles are installed





*bundle:list -s | grep alto204 | Resolved |  80 |

org.opendaylight.l2switch.hosttracker.impl *

None of the bundles are installed

Another things is that when I review the activated ports:









* nmap chimayStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org <http://nmap.org> ) at
2015-08-21 11:15 BRTNmap scan report for chimay (127.0.1.1)Host is up

The 8181 port is not activited

I dont know exactly what happen,

Thank

*feature:install odl-dlux-all odl-alto-all*

And it would be helpful if you can check and post the karaf log, which
locates in ./alto-karaf/target/assembly/data/log/karaf.log


Please let us know if that works. Thanks.

0,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/,alto-dev,message,[alto-dev] Few questions on ALTO and ONOS,2015-08-22 00:19:15,+0800,jingxuan.n.zhang at gmail.com (Jensen Zhang),<CAAbpuyoNOzjD5HBH1ZNY49EX0JU+eN=dPRRr=-BGZpdba-Uw8Q@mail.gmail.com>,"s that you were using the latest *master* branch
code in the ODL gerrit, right? This branch is unstable, and still has some
bugs which are not fixed by us. So I suggest you try the *stable/lithium*
branch, and I think the odl-alto-provider feature can work well in this
branch. Also, we will fix bugs and make master branch work as soon as
possible. But this is a developing branch and we are adding many new
functions for it, so I cannot make sure it is stable.

The apidoc explorer (http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html) is
provided by ODL (
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Restconf_API_Explorer),
and it is independent of odl-alto-* feature. So I guess the karaf was not
set up normally, if you couldn't connect to it. You can check the karaf log
for more details, or post it up so that we can help you solve the problem
better.

Best,
Jensen

STABLE/LITHIUM branch and I already have available
http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html. Now, I will continue
testing some others ALTO Features and any other question or problem I will
write. We at University of Campinas are developing a proof of concept of
ALTO server implementation (for IXP-related use cases) based on Neo4j graph
DB and OpenDaylight.

So once again, many thanks.

ps: I think that the manual (
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nx2U5WvVlCU-dierN-EF9L5iAzRrNNr1S73EzsSjAmo/edit#)
could be updated because It is not clearly specified what kind of branch
should be downloaded.

Because you introduce a new package into alto-northbound, you have to add
new bundles or features in the 'odl-alto-northbound' feature. (It will be
located in 'features/src/main/features/features.xml' or
'features/src/main/resources/features.xml'.)

But for your problem, I don't suggest you use *org.codehaus.jackson* in
alto-northbound, unless necessary. Because:

1. You can use com.fasterxml.jackson.core [2], since this is a newer
jackson implementation than org.codehaus.jackson. And we have imported
bundles for this into alto-commons which is an dependency of
alto-northbound, so you can just repleace the dependency declaration in
alto-northbound by this new one.
2. But you'd better not use jackson in northbound module. It is just a
front-end and it should not implement any complex logic. You can implement
your functions in alto-services or alto-provider. For example, the
implementation of 'getNetworkMap' is in
'alto-services/provider/simple-alto/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/alto/services/provider/simple/SimpleAltoService.java'.

Hope this is helpful to you.

Hi Colin,

 

This is a very good suggestion.  I???ve created a wiki page which I will
soon populate based on my previous experience with M2 and M3.  But other
folks should feel free to add their own thoughts as well.

 

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release:Guides:M2

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release:Guides:M3

 

Best Regards,

An Ho

*Subject:* [release] survival guides for M2 and M3?

 

There's substantially more that needs to be done for M2 and M3 than M1
and we have a bunch of new projects in Beryllium. To help that, it would
be useful if people that had been through it a few times could provide
some form of guide to getting through it.

Is anyone willing to take that on?

Cheers,

--Colin

2. The requirements of ECS service from Lenovo;
3. The architecture of our ECS design;
4. Other details of our ECS implementation.

So we desire a summarize sync up, which is not late than 8th, Sept. Beijing
time, directly to their development team. And we may have multiply meetings
with their dev team to talk about their requirements and our limitations in
next week (7th to 13th). Then we can quickly iterate our ECS design in the
following two weeks (14th to 27th). Finally we may give a final version to
Lenovo in the week of National Day.

Dear Kai,

I sure am impressed by the work of you three. As main contributors of
the ALTO project, I support you three to become commiters to move the
project further:
Jensen: +1
Kai: +1
Shu: +1

    |Hi Richardand all,

    I'd like to nominate three new committers for the ALTO project:
    Jensen, Kai and Shu.

    Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality
    [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of
    the development team.

    Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release
    [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project
    currently.

As I see it you have 8 committers listed here:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/ALTO:Main

That's also odd because you only have 5 initial committers listed here and
I don't remember the TSC approving more:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Alto#Initial_Committers

More odd is that you seem to have added  Huaming Guo as an initial
committer after the project was approved on January 8th:

I think there is a misunderstanding here. When we listed the names on the
preceding Web page, we thought those names would be contributors, i.e.,
they would participate in the project, but without the ability to commit in
the sense of git approval. Hence, I am the only git committer/approver.
This also explains why we added Huaming without seeking the approval of
TSC. Does this clarify?

Hi:

When you and your team fill the form, if you don't want to expose your
exactly location, please at least give me city, state and country
instead of just a company name or city name. So google map can recognize
it and i don't need to manually search your company's address since we
have hundreds of people in our community. 

Thanks a lot for help making this map.

There were 4 committers listed:
* Xiao Shi (Shixiao) (Yale University)
* Xin (Tony) Wang (Tonywang) (Tongji University)
* Y. Richard Yang (Yrichardyang) (Yale/Tongji University)
* Wendy Roome (Wdroome) (Bell Labs)

Those four people should have full committer rights in gerrit and should
also be voting members of the project when it comes to adding new
committers.

Along those lines, I have 3 requests:
1.) Remove Huaming Guo as an initial committer fomr the project proposal,
since he wasn't one.
2.) If it's possible get the other current committers (Xiao, Xin, and
Wendy) to vote on the newly proposed committers.
3.) Remove the new committers (Shu, Kai, Guohai, and Yichen) from the main
page until they are voted on by the project committers and approved by the
TSC.

Let me know if that makes sense.

development team. Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO
Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this
project currently.""

  Vote (please vote +1, 0, -1). My vote is +1

2. Proposal: Add Guohai as a new committer after ALTO client check in:

   Justification: Guohai has made substantial contribution to write an ALTO
client. If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include
Guohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?

  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.

3. Proposal: Add Junzhuo as a new committer after new ALTO version check in.

  Vote: Pending Junzhuo check in.

4. Remove Xiao from the committers, as Xiao no longer participates in the
ALTO project.

  Vote: +1

Please share your opinions when you can.

Thanks.

Dear Wendy, Xiao, Xin,

May I propose the following changes to committers:

1. Proposal: Add Kai,  Shu, Jensen, as new committers.

   Justification (copy from Kai's summary):
   ""Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of the development team. Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project currently.""

  Vote (please vote +1, 0, -1). My vote is +1

2. Proposal: Add Guohai as a new committer after ALTO client check in:

   Justification: Guohai has made substantial contribution to write an ALTO client. If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include Guohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?

  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.

3. Proposal: Add Junzhuo as a new committer after new ALTO version check in.

  Vote: Pending Junzhuo check in.

4. Remove Xiao from the committers, as Xiao no longer participates in the ALTO project.

  Vote: +1

Please share your opinions when you can.

Thanks.
Richard

There were 4 committers listed:
* Xiao Shi (Shixiao) (Yale University)
* Xin (Tony) Wang (Tonywang) (Tongji University)
* Y. Richard Yang (Yrichardyang) (Yale/Tongji University)
* Wendy Roome (Wdroome) (Bell Labs)
Those four people should have full committer rights in gerrit and should also be voting members of the project when it comes to adding new committers.
Along those lines, I have 3 requests:
1.) Remove Huaming Guo as an initial committer fomr the project proposal, since he wasn't one.
2.) If it's possible get the other current committers (Xiao, Xin, and Wendy) to vote on the newly proposed committers.
3.) Remove the new committers (Shu, Kai, Guohai, and Yichen) from the main page until they are voted on by the project committers and approved by the TSC.


The three requests make sense. Let us follow the procedure and get them done soon.

Thanks for the guidance!
Richard

Let me know if that makes sense.

I think there is a misunderstanding here. When we listed the names on the preceding Web page, we thought those names would be contributors, i.e., they would participate in the project, but without the ability to commit in the sense of git approval. Hence, I am the only git committer/approver. This also explains why we added Huaming without seeking the approval of TSC. Does this clarify?

Richard


That's also odd because you only have 5 initial committers listed here and I don't remember the TSC approving more:

Dear Kai,

I sure am impressed by the work of you three. As main contributors of the ALTO project, I support you three to become commiters to move the project further:
Jensen: +1
Kai: +1
Shu: +1

Hi Richard and all,

I'd like to nominate three new committers for the ALTO project: Jensen, Kai and Shu.

Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of the development team.

Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project currently.

Robert,

It is great to have your contribution! I know that you have contributed an ALTO client when we conducted the previous interop in July. My feeling is that after we conduct a code review and you check in the client as a good part of ALTO/ODL, it will be a good base for you to become a committer. How does this sound?

Wendy/Xin: what do you think?

Dear Wendy, Xiao, Xin,

May I propose the following changes to committers:

1. Proposal: Add Kai,  Shu, Jensen, as new committers.

   Justification (copy from Kai's summary):
   ""Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of the development team. Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project currently.""

  Vote (please vote +1, 0, -1). My vote is +1

2. Proposal: Add Guohai as a new committer after ALTO client check in:

   Justification: Guohai has made substantial contribution to write an ALTO client. If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include Guohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?

  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.

3. Proposal: Add Junzhuo as a new committer after new ALTO version check in.

  Vote: Pending Junzhuo check in.

4. Remove Xiao from the committers, as Xiao no longer participates in the ALTO project.

  Vote: +1

Please share your opinions when you can.

Thanks.
Richard

* Wendy Roome (Wdroome) (Bell Labs)
Those four people should have full committer rights in gerrit and should also be voting members of the project when it comes to adding new committers.
Along those lines, I have 3 requests:
1.) Remove Huaming Guo as an initial committer fomr the project proposal, since he wasn't one.
2.) If it's possible get the other current committers (Xiao, Xin, and Wendy) to vote on the newly proposed committers.
3.) Remove the new committers (Shu, Kai, Guohai, and Yichen) from the main page until they are voted on by the project committers and approved by the TSC.


The three requests make sense. Let us follow the procedure and get them done soon.

Thanks for the guidance!
Richard

Let me know if that makes sense.

Out of curiosity, what do you mean when you say ""Richard, the only committer of ALTO project at the moment""?
As I see it you have 8 committers listed here:

I think there is a misunderstanding here. When we listed the names on the preceding Web page, we thought those names would be contributors, i.e., they would participate in the project, but without the ability to commit in the sense of git approval. Hence, I am the only git committer/approver. This also explains why we added Huaming without seeking the approval of TSC. Does this clarify?

Richard


That's also odd because you only have 5 initial committers listed here and I don't remember the TSC approving more:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Alto#Initial_Committers<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wiki.opendaylight.org_view_Project-5FProposals-3AAlto-23Initial-5FCommitters&d=AwMFaQ&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=nomUG6iXrvN5BBRA5FIhGJR3lzVqaO8KVxV0uCZ19nU&s=9Cl8Uq3TZh_ZCIg3mhEEG9ID-154lrl9mgyQvrS0tYg&e=>
More odd is that you seem to have added  Huaming Guo as an initial committer after the project was approved on January 8th:

Robert,

It is great to have your contribution! I know that you have contributed an ALTO client when we conducted the previous interop in July. My feeling is that after we conduct a code review and you check in the client as a good part of ALTO/ODL, it will be a good base for you to become a committer. How does this sound?

Wendy/Xin: what do you think?

Richard

Subject: [alto-dev] Fwd: [OpenDaylight TSC] Fwd: Re: New committers

Dear Wendy, Xiao, Xin,

May I propose the following changes to committers:

1. Proposal: Add Kai,  Shu, Jensen, as new committers.

   Justification (copy from Kai's summary):
   ""Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of the development team. Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project currently.""

  Vote (please vote +1, 0, -1). My vote is +1

2. Proposal: Add Guohai as a new committer after ALTO client check in:

   Justification: Guohai has made substantial contribution to write an ALTO client. If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include Guohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?

  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.

3. Proposal: Add Junzhuo as a new committer after new ALTO version check in.

  Vote: Pending Junzhuo check in.

4. Remove Xiao from the committers, as Xiao no longer participates in the ALTO project.

  Vote: +1

Please share your opinions when you can.

Thanks.
Richard

There were 4 committers listed:
* Xiao Shi (Shixiao) (Yale University)
* Xin (Tony) Wang (Tonywang) (Tongji University)
* Y. Richard Yang (Yrichardyang) (Yale/Tongji University)
* Wendy Roome (Wdroome) (Bell Labs)
Those four people should have full committer rights in gerrit and should also be voting members of the project when it comes to adding new committers.
Along those lines, I have 3 requests:
1.) Remove Huaming Guo as an initial committer fomr the project proposal, since he wasn't one.
2.) If it's possible get the other current committers (Xiao, Xin, and Wendy) to vote on the newly proposed committers.
3.) Remove the new committers (Shu, Kai, Guohai, and Yichen) from the main page until they are voted on by the project committers and approved by the TSC.


The three requests make sense. Let us follow the procedure and get them done soon.

Thanks for the guidance!
Richard

Let me know if that makes sense.

I think there is a misunderstanding here. When we listed the names on the preceding Web page, we thought those names would be contributors, i.e., they would participate in the project, but without the ability to commit in the sense of git approval. Hence, I am the only git committer/approver. This also explains why we added Huaming without seeking the approval of TSC. Does this clarify?

Richard


That's also odd because you only have 5 initial committers listed here and I don't remember the TSC approving more:

Yes, I expected that. Do you think it is worth mentioning that in the
section?

Because the SSE specification recommends that as a keep-alive. From Section
8:

I will expand Section 4.3 and say that SSE recommends sending a comment as a
keep-alive every 15 seconds.

The stop-updates request is on a new HTTP connection. I will try to make
that clearer.

I would have loved to send the stop-updates on the same stream. But I don't
think that is compatible with HTTP 1.1. The de-facto convention is that the
client sends all its data first, then the server sends its response. While
the HTTP 1.1 spec might let us squeak around that, I think most HTTP client
libraries and HTTP server frameworks enforce that convention, so a client or
server might have to do their own HTTP implementation. That would make it
much harder to adopt the extension.

As for a load-balanced server pool, the server which gets the stop-updates
request is responsible for forwarding it to the appropriate server. For
example, the stream-id could have the id of the specific server. The server
which gets stop-updates simply sends a side-channel cease-and-desist order
to the server handling the update stream, and then replies to the client.
Note that this is a simple reply, not a HTTP redirect or some sort of TCP
reconnection.

Fixed the typo.

If you want to follow UNIX conventions, we would
    { ""stop-updates"": [""*""] }
to stop all updates. But that means a server cannot use * as a resource id
(granted, I doubt that will bother anyone). Also, I suspect most users will
want to stop all updates. I included the selective-stop for logical
completeness.

So I have no problem with an empty array meaning stop-all.

I have not seen anything defining a command structure on top of SSE.

Subject: Re: How to compute the routing path between two hosts in OpenDayLight?

Hi l2switch team,

I have changed the l2switch to construct flow entries to build shortest path between hosts and also provide the routing information to other modules. I'm very happy to submit my code and I have pushed my modified l2switch on github here: https://github.com/cs512/l2switch.

The current problem is that my modify is dummy so I need review. If any of you willing to do so, please contact me.

Regards,
Junzhuo

I would highly encourage you to submit your enhancements to l2switch. Please start contributing the project. Submit your proposal for Beryllium release.

Subject: Re: How to compute the routing path between two hosts in OpenDayLight?

To add a bit, according to my understanding:
- current l2switch uses flooding based on a single, shared spanning. Hence, assume a switch with k neighbors in the spanning tree, it needs only k rules in its flow table: for each incoming neighbor, flood to the other k-1 neighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing ECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst pair is the same.

- As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority flow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from the tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that this may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:
* We identify compression.
* Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules. They are triggered by packet-in only.
* Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively short timeout. He"

- In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path to an l3 path.

In the long run, the preceding is not complete. For example, what if GBP reroutes a flow through middle boxes. The preceding derivation based on l2switch routing is not correct. We need to look into the composition approach of ODL.

Hi Mingming,

The current status is that Dijkstra algorithm is not be used in l2switch. The related code are all been annotated. And the authors of l2switch also says this module is not complete. Instead, it use STP to forward all packets to every devices in the network. So we decide to develop our own module ?l2switch-plus? to enhance the ability of l2switch. As a result, we can get routing information easily.

A further question. Is there a layer 3 routing module could make OpenFlow switcher acts like a traditional router?

Thanks!
Junzhuo


Hi Evan,

It great to have your reply! I?ve seen that the method ?addBidirectionalMacToMacFlows? calls ?addMacToMacFlow? twice. Based on the code, I assume in this implementation, the STP eliminate loops so all packets can be forwarded to all switchers. So only two flow entries could build a path between two MAC addresses.

But in my test, the MAC to MAC flow only be built when two hosts connected to the same switcher. This phenomenon really confuses me. I?m looking forward to your reply.

Thanks!
Junzhuo


The Minimum Spanning Tree is calculated to prevent loops in the network, those links that receive STP blocking status won't have flows written on them. FlowWriterServiceImpl.java in l2switch-main may have what you're looking for, it can create mac to mac flows, I'm not sure how robust the functionality is at the moment.

Hi all,

I?m a member from ODL/ALTO. I?m trying to find a API to compute the routing path between two hosts. So I read the code from openflowplugin, controller. It seems openflowplugin just set the flow table to switchers. And controller seems no longer handle the routing calculation now
 (org.opendaylight.controller.sal.routing doesn?t exist now).

Finally I found this page(<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wiki.opendaylight.org_view_OpenDaylight-5FController-3AMD-2DSAL-3AL2-5FSwitch&d=AwMFbw&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=1Dgsyw24QLzoIhrwYfaQw2pIpT0WjsryWfiJew7gwKM&s=jcqCyDHS2n6BlBpCKMf1jFHI_VW1DdbeURlIE3s8bZI&e=>https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:L2_Switch<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wiki.opendaylight.org_view_OpenDaylight-5FController-3AMD-2DSAL-3AL2-5FSwitch&d=AwMFbw&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=1Dgsyw24QLzoIhrwYfaQw2pIpT0WjsryWfiJew7gwKM&s=jcqCyDHS2n6BlBpCKMf1jFHI_VW1DdbeURlIE3s8bZI&e=>) saids that the l2switch now provide routing service.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: *Wendy Roome* <w.roome at alcatel-lucent.com>
Date: Tuesday, September 29, 2015
Subject: [alto] New Incremental Update draft
To: ""alto at ietf.org"" <alto at ietf.org>


Folks,

Richard & I updated the incremental update draft:

https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ietf.org_internet-2Ddrafts_draft-2Dietf-2Dalto-2Dincr-2Dupdate-2Dsse-2D01.txt&d=AwICAg&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=DOFJXxQJVz_ERNgTqwtat30JEEXyPxEyMPYBPvV8rqY&s=slfp3TRkN394bivOqmD24pjhcrOGj7qyTMNTJYVSBIQ&e=


The primary change was I added a mechanism to let a client tell the server
to close the stream. This shuts the stream down quickly & cleanly. The
client can just close the stream, of course, but that can take a while for
the server to detect, and it looks like an I/O error.

Section 3 summarizes the other changes, most of which are clarifications.

The Alcatel-Lucent public server,
https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__alto.alcatel-2Dlucent.com-3A8000_directory&d=AwICAg&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=DOFJXxQJVz_ERNgTqwtat30JEEXyPxEyMPYBPvV8rqY&s=TWWzEEQgxCMd17ICx7chi8-DKni-0kcxNL1SVxaxFAo&e=
, provides an Update Stream
resource as described in the -01 draft. The server updates the default
network map every 60 minutes (approximately), and every 5 minutes it
updates a few routingcost values for the default network map and a few
property values.

Note that because that server handles the interop test network, the
updates just replace the current values with the same values. But that
counts as an update in my server, so it exercises all of the update
plumbing.

One wart: when you create a new Update Stream, the initial response is
delayed for 50 seconds. I don't know what causes that delay, but it only
happens on this particular server, and it is very repeatable. That server
is in our corporate DMZ, so it may be a result of the firewall, or
routing, or some other security feature. In any case, once you get over
the initial 50 second delay, subsequent updates arrive quickly.

Oh yes, I could not find an SSE library, so I had to write my own. I would
greatly appreciate it if other people could try it and verify that my SSE
implementation meets the specification.

        - Wendy Roome

The problem I see is when l2-switch (and host tracker) is enabled ,
hosts start to appear on different nodes as you can see in the picture
below. Our intention to use l2-switch is to get the topology and hosts
automatically discovered, but not to let it push the flow rules by
itself. Thus I apply these two configs to ODL:

is-proactive-flood-mode=false
is-learning-only-mode=true

But still hosts appear to multiple nodes. Any suggestions ?

Thanks

If you want to push your own flow entry. The setting should be fine but I saw no default flow in your switches. Because normally all switch should have a default flow entry. The HostTracker may not working if the LLDP or ARP packets are not sent to controller properly.

Actually, I am always tracing this bug during these days. And when I built

Even more, when I built it just now, I found there had been no error. But I

One of the switch in the topology is Dell Z9000, this switch has buggy
OF implementation and was passing the hosts and link info from one
instance to other, thus completely confusing the whole topology.

I might have more questions regarding the Python flow insertion into

I agree. This specific issue seems to be related with just the Dell
Z9000 only. This has the OpenFlow implementation but code is only under
maintenance. So hopefully Dell will release some upgraded firmware to
get this fixed.

I remember you mentioned some of the code improvements in l2switch, can
you please list the bug fixes or improvements you have made  ? We are
getting ready for the SC15 conference and the current arp manager of the
ODL has issues, and it would be nice to have a better error free
l2switch from you. Please let me know.

Thanks

packet on the network, which is not effective. And ODL does not have a
service to provide routing information. So basically what I did is:

1. Replace spin tree with shortest path algorithm to build a p2p flow
between two hosts;
2. Add APIs to provide routing information.

An issue is that openflow-plugin, a module what L2Switch depends on, has
some bugs. So L2Switch may not compact with every switch. I'll try to solve
your problem by reading the spec of Dell Z9100 and the docs of
openflow-plugin.

Austin (Junzhuo)

into one pid.

A possible solution now is to set a new network map manually from cli.
However, it is not a good solution. Users still would like to get automatic
network map. Maybe we can provide a default algorithm to generate pids, or
allow users to define the algorithm by themselves.

they didn'timplement PID partition.  I'llforward your e-mail to confirm
that.

However, in an internal meeting this July we did discuss about PID
partition using hosttrackerso I think there might be some progress on that.

Besides, you can report it as a bug by visiting
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=alto.  Sincethere
are some major changes in the latest release and we have limited
manpower, I can't really guarantee that this issue can be fixed soon
enough. :(

We really appreciate your participation and we look forward to getting
more feedbacks from you.  Thanks very much!

helps us to get priority, let's start some specific discussions.

What we need is a mechanism so that an admin can define the partition of
hosts into PIDs. Let me give a try to start a strawman.

We can consider the hosts in the network as leaves in a graph. Each host
also has a set of attributes (e.g., geolocation) beyond the graph
properties. Hence, I assume that we need a mechanism to use these
properties to group the hosts. A first idea coming to mind is cluster
analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).

Let me start with an anchor based approach. Assume that we allow the admin
to define a set of anchors, where each anchor is a switch.
{
   ""netmap-grouping-alg"": ""nearest-anchor"",

   ""alg-metric"": ""hopcount"",     // it could be ""nearest geo-location"", if
we know

   ""anchors"": [ ""sw1"", sw3"", ""sw4""],

   ""cost-map-cal-alg"": ""avg""   // cost from pid1 (sw1 cluster) to pid2 (sw2
cluster) is the average of host pairs
}
Then we can see that it defines three PIDs, where each PID is defined by an
anchor in anchors. When an host is added, we can automatically compute
which anchor is the nearest and hence assign it to it. We can prove that
each PID is a connected component, if we assume the full graph is
connected, when we consider graph hopcount.

How to define a more general mechanism?

Hence each PID is seeded with a set, instead of a single switch. We can
then approximate other design, for example using regular expressions.

Seeding with fixed switches may not be flexible. For example, what if you
want a new switch to be an anchor. An alternative us to provide tags to
switches. For example, the nearest-anchor call only defines the network map
name and the names of pids. We have an API to allow assign tags to switch:
sw1 -> netmap1:pid2, netmap3:pid10

In a sense we provide a map management API, which allows create maps,
defines the grouping algorithm (e.g., nearest-anchor), and tag switches, ...

Note that link based partition can be interesting as well.

First according to this <https://www.opendaylight.org/faq#7>, this
<https://www.opendaylight.org/faq#24> and this
<https://www.opendaylight.org/tsc-charter>, only the commiters can vote
for committer nominations and project leader election.

According to Collin, a member of ODL TSC
<https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/2015-September/000222.html>,
there are only 4 committers and since there was no voting (as far as I
know) you and I are not legal project leaders at the moment.

It would be great if someone can continue to push forward the process of
committer nominations
<https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/2015-September/000216.html>
and also this co-lead election. One major issue is that we must get at
least 3 votes from the four committers, especially from Shi and Wendy.

Thanks for letting the ALTO group know about NetJSON. NetJSON is related
to the proposed ALTO extensions to describe network topology. However, I
think ALTO's needs are sufficiently different, and sufficiently simpler,
that there is no advantage using NetJSON in ALTO.

The proposed ALTO topology extensions give clients a very simple, abstract
view of the network so that clients can determine how much the paths
between endpoints overlap. E.g., suppose a client wants to do parallel
backups to two different cloud servers. If the paths to servers A & B have
many common elements, while the paths to servers A & C do not, the client
would prefer to use A & C.

ALTO could use the NetJSON NetworkGraph sub-schema to describe topology,
but that is considerably more complicated than what we have proposed. For
example, a NetworkGraph has nodes, links that connect nodes, and
descriptions of routing protocols. The front-runner for describing
topology in ALTO is to provide a list of abstract network elements
involved in the path between two endpoint clusters. The elements can be
nodes, links, or combinations of those. A NetJSON NetworkGraph is
considerably more complicated, and much closer to the physical network.

Also, ALTO clients are typically enduser applications with minimal
knowledge of network internals. They want ALTO to hide the details and
give them just what the need, and no more. So few ALTO clients would need
the rest of NetJSON, and forcing them to learn it would just make it
harder to use ALTO. Similarly, I doubt that NetJSON libraries would
simplify ALTO clients; it would just mean a client has to learn how to
turn off features the client will never use.

responsibilities and we are willing to take them, just like Shu and I
used to (Hope we didn'tmess anything up).  My point is, the title
doesn't really affect us.  Whoever selected as the PTL will participate
in ODL activities as he should, and those whoare not will still play
their roles in the project.  Since we don't really have the time to
fully go through the regulations and may have made some amateur
mistakes, we are very delighted to have the guidance from the TSC.

p.s. Not sure I get thepunchlineof $0.02 here...You are just being
humbler, right?

Kai

George and TSC,
After discussing, we reach the following agreement:
- Kai is the PTL.
- Add Jensen as a new Project Contact.
Once getting your confirm, we will update our Main wiki and Beryllium Release Plan wiki. Please let me know, if there is anything else that needs to be done.

Yes, of course. Actually, it is him that comes up with the suggestion. Since he is not a committer, I start the voting for him.

The folks at CalTech woking on the Large Hadron Collider are using
OpenDaylight to distribute the data they collect to a network of
participating universities and they're interested in using ALTO as part of
that effort.

However, they are having some issues in getting everything stood up.  Could
you guys take a look at the email below and respond to Losif Legrand and
team with any insights you may have?

Thanks in advance for your help with this.

Phil.

you are using OpenDaylight Lithium Release. But It seems that you are not
using the Lithium Release. These modules you list in karaf are in our
master branch, so the Lithium User Guide is not fit for them.

However, I am not sure how you install your OpenDaylight. May I get your
command-line history or some logs so that we can help you better?

BTW. I think you can get the pre-built version of ODL Lithium-SR2 from this
link (https://www.opendaylight.org/downloads).

So I
assume you're using Beryllium 0.4.0, which is not a stable version either.
I suggest you downgrade to a stable version of ODL, say 0.3.2-Lithium-SR2,
to solve these problems.

in the context of your wonderful project. The feedback from you is great
for the ALTO project to improve. At the same time, we apology for the
inaccuracies and hence the issues caused.

Here is my proposal to move forward:
1. We will first go over the issues discovered by you in your email, one by
one, to verify and proposal fixes; please give us two days;
2. After 1., we want to schedule a meet up with you to go over the issues
with you and work together; I believe that no one is more motivated than us
to fix the issues;
3. After 2., we will send a summary to Phil and others on what both ALTO
and other ODL project can learn to improve.

How does the preceding sound?

ALTO.

We would like to use ALTO based on  the North Bound REST API.
As the time we have until SC15 is quite short, it wll be very useful for
us if you have some examples in how o use it.

I would like to start with a quite simple topology ( the attached diagram )
where we have four sites in a ring and than I hope we can extend it for 
more complex cases.

Thank you very much.

Best Regards,
Iosif

website soon.

If you notice we have a mix of hardware from various vendors, however
only Dell and Brocade will be part of the OF topology. Mellanox spectrum
does not support OF yet.

In the Interconnect diagram you will see the various hosts which will be
dedicated to different demos, so that people running those demos will
have free hand to continue their demos. I can dedicate few more machines
where ALTO can be demonstrated, we need to ensure that everything will
work involving ALTO.

If you/team need early access to test/install any particular software in
the testbed environment, please send me your keys and your source IP
addresses.

I am also available at ""626.318.0100 "" for any quick call.

Thanks

Richard Yang),<CANUuoLpeiGTER==JKtGMeKD7cBwhuCp-4BnubEW9xZikq-M1Bg@mail.gmail.com>,"had some more internal discussions, based on our discussions
last night. Here is an outline:

====
Entities:
- Endhost: Each endhost will have a data directory, which hosts the files
that it
  has, for example, file1, file2, file3, ...
- File tracker: There is a file tracker which keeps track of the files that
each
  endhost has as a map: <endhost> -> <list of files>
- Scheduler: There is a scheduler which accepts transfer tasks and
schedules
  the transfers
- ODL SDN controller

Processes:
- Endhost: There is an agent running on each endhost to monitor the
existing
  files and update the file tracker on the file index; The endhost tracker
will also
  ping each other to get latency and report the results to the ALTO server
in
  the SDN controller; The agent (or a remote command) can start a file
transfer.

- File tracker: accepts
  queries on files available at each endhost, and
  posts to update the file index

- Scheduler: Schedule the transfers, where each transfer has the following
  attributes: client-endpoint, file-name, priority, deadline. In
particular, the frontend
  (or API) has a form to allow others to submit transfer requests; The
backend will
  query the network status and compute the scheduling of transfers.

Details of the scheduling backend to schedule a set of transfers. Assume
that all
the transfers are given in a batch (T1, T2, ... TK) for the demo.
- Query File tracker to obtain the replicas of the each data in the batch
- Query ALTO to obtain the routing path for each T1(file).replica:
path(T1(client),
  T1(file).replica)
- Query ALTO to obtain the path properties such as latency of the routing
paths
- Conduct scheduling (i.e., replica selection and maximum flow based for
deadline
and priority), based on estimating TCP throughput (based on TCP throughput
formula; the throughput of each flow is inverse proportional to its latency)
- Issue transfer commands to the endhosts.

It looks like that some of your packages (e.g., MoniLisa) can be used for
the
preceding. We are looking into.

Thanks a lot. Let us take a look on how to use FDT.

I saw that MoniLisa is running on the controller VM. Will it be used in the
demo?

The port stat provides traffic volumes (and if we pull frequent enough, we
can have reasonable rate estimate; capacity minus this will give available
bw). ALTO assumes that path is computed by other modules, because this
function should be configured by users such as involving SFC, GBP or not...
For this demo, what is the Path Computation approach? We can work together
to set up the path computation module and then ALTO can help to pick the
best data source. Please let us know.

Thanks a lot!
Richard

This is run very much like iperf


We use Monalisa for monitoring. It is not necessary to have it in a VM

Concerning the path computation,  one possibility is to get the maximum
throughput . Is any ODL module that can do this ?

To use the new path computation module alto-spce in ODL, it is best to be invoked by your UI code, which will invoke Python-ODL. This means that we need to modify your JS UI code and your backend server. Is this OK at this stage? We do not want to mess up your working demo :-)

Actually we have submitted some patches for csit, but they have not been
merged. Just like https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/30553/ and
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/32581/. (But the second patch still
has some problems and we are fixing them.)

That is the elephant in the room. There are more than a few and I'm
trying to work through them as fast as I can. If anyone wants to help,
I've been creating this style guide which can also act as docs reviewer
checklist:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Documentation/Style_Guide

If people could go through with that in mind and +1/-1 thinks that would
make my job faster. If not, I'll move as fast as I can.

Hi all,

For those projects doing system test (csit), we plan to change default tools image (aka mininet VM) from Centos 6 based to Ubuntu based:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/35041/

There should be no impact but just be aware in case something is observed.

I also take the opportunity to remind current available general purpose tool images:

- ubuntu-trusty-mininet: OVS 2.0 (ubuntu default), mininet 2.1, CPqD, CBench, exabgp
- ubuntu-trusty-mininet-ovs23: OVS 2.3, mininet 2.2, CPqD, Cbench, exabgp

BR/Luis

Wikis (or at least the ones I know of) are poorly suited to keeping
multiple different versions of the same content (for different releases)
up-to-date, so most pages are just for whatever release was current when
they were written. To help with that, I created templates for each
release here:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Wiki_gardening#Gardening_Templates

You can use them by doing {{Helium Release}} at the top of a page where
you can replace Helium with whatever release you'd like. An example is
this page:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Toaster_Tutorial

Pretty much nobody uses those templates. They are nice though because
they can be used to dynamically insert warnings about content when it
gets out of date and also add pages to the relevant category for the
release.

    Pair up is a great idea.

    ? 

    One feedback I had is that in our document as well as wiki, it
    doesn???t mention the instructions are for which release version.

    ? 

    I think this is because when we write those instructions, we always
    assume it is for current version, and when we have a new
    current, we don???t go back to update old docs.

    ? 

    In Boron, one idea I have to better distribute the burden of
    reviewing documentation is to have projects to documentation
    peer-review. I'm not 100% sure how to do it, but my first intuition
    is to pair projects up and require that they review each others
    documentation for clarity, grammar, spelling, formatting, etc.
    before the Documentation team reviews and merges it.

    Thoughts?

It still needs work but my current documentation for Maven sites is here
[0]. Some of it is not relevant to integration project though. I can
help review patches and make sure they do the right thing though.

I'm also thinking of moving the documentation to odlparent since
odlparent is what provides the activation currently.

please disregard this email and I look forward to seeing you next Monday.

HOWEVER, if you haven't registered, I'd like to reiterate the importance of  
getting together face to face with both members of your particular project  
as well as the rest of the OpenDaylight development community.  Not only  
can you kickstart development activities for Boron within your project, but  
we will also discuss critical project-wide topics such as the changes to  
the build environment and Release process, as well as key new features and  
technologies soon to be added to the platform that may be of significant  
importance to you... and then just getting to put faces with irc-handles is  
always a big win for everybody.

Please attend if it is at all possible.  The DDF is the *best* way to meet  
and work with other key developers in the ODL community to make great  
advances on what is important to you.

The DDF logistics are:
When:  Next Monday & Tuesday (February 29th, and March 1st), 9:00am to  
5:00pm each day
Where:  San Mateo Marriott San Francisco Airport
               1770 S Amphlett Blvd
               San Mateo, CA 94402
               +1 650-653-6000

Remember we run the event as both a standard technical conference and also  
as an unconference.  You are welcome and encouraged to submit discussion  
topics important to you on this wiki page:

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Events:Boron_Dev_Forum

Please post any new entries to the bottom of that page.  I'll collect the  
topics on a daily basis and populate the pre-defined schedule with them.   
That schedule is located here:

http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/opendaylight-developer-design-forum/program/schedule

We will also have additional rooms set aside for project teams and/or  
cross-project groups to get together to work through issues and ideas in an  
ad-hoc (aka unconference) style.

If you are able to attend, please register as soon as you are able.

Subject: [releng] Maven Site generation
To: linxiao9292 at outlook.com; dev at lists.opendaylight.org

Hi Xiao,
In the future please send these types of inquiries to the [releng] topic at dev at lists.opendaylight.org
The best way to test Maven Site locally that I've found is to run 2 commands as follows:
    mvn clean install    mvn site:deploy -Dstream=latest
The 1st command generates your documentation, because the way Maven Site generation works it produces all the documentation but does not produce working URL paths that you can use so we need the 2nd command.
The 2nd command aggregates all the documentation into a staging site. This will produce a directory in your project root called ""target/staged-site"". The string -Dstream can be set to anything, it just represents what version of your site documentation you want to call it. Typically Jenkins will use our release names such as -Dstream=beryllium or -Dstream=boron etc...
You can now open the site with your webbrowser by opening any of the html files for example:
    google-chrome target/staged-site/index.html
Hope this helps,Thanh

Hi folks,

We need all the dependent projects of OpenFlow Plugin (OFP) to move to
the Lithium design for the Boron release. To help in this process
OpenFlow Plugin has created an unmerged patch which swaps the default
design to the? 
???new? ???
Lithium design. The patch
is:? *https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/35892.? *The purpose of
this patch is for projects to? identify issues in the migration and help
OpenFlow Plugin fix them.? 

To use this patch projects should:
1.? 
clone the openflowplugin and then checkout this patch
? it locally
??? and build
2.? 
??????
t
???est???
? 
???their project with the locally swapped new plugin? 

We would like this activity to identify issues to conclude in the next 2
weeks or so (say? March 24? - which happens to be the current offset 2
projects M1 date in the provisional traditional release plan ). That way
OpenFlow Plugin can factor the gaps needed to fix in the OpenFlow Plugin
release plan which is due by M2 for us (current date in the provisional
traditional release plan for OFP is? April 21). The OFP target for
fixing the issues and actually changing the default plugin would likely
be either OFP M2 or M3 - depending on the complexity of the issues
identified. The issues which cannot be worked around? 
???and? blocking development of the project? ???
should be raised as blocker issues on OpenFlow Plugin.

Again as I mentioned - please try this patch out and let us know the
issues by? March 24. If there is an issue in providing this info -
please let us know as well.


Thanks,
Abhijit

Jinmin,

Thanks for your work and the efforts are highly appreciated.  Since ALTO
is part of the OpenDaylight, could you please try to follow Thanh's
suggestions on how the community works? Also, merging patches from
stable/beryllium to master is not a task you must accomplish all on your
own.  If you cherry-pick the patches one by one, others such as Thanh,
who has helped us a lot with the development, can also help resolve the
conflicts.  Jensen and I are also watching the commits so we can provide
some help too.


To the rest of the ALTO development team,

This can be a good chance to learn from our mistakes and to get a better
understanding of how open source communities work.  It can take a while
for all of us to fit in the culture but I think it's something we should
always do.

Thanks!

Kai

While I do see that you kept the commit messages aggregated in your message, tools like spectrometer, github, openhub, etc... do not take this into account and will show that the alto project is less diverse a community than it really is. One of the greatest things about open source development for a contributor is that they can refer back to code that they contributed to a project, squashed commits make this significantly harder.

needs to be cherry-picked to other branches as well. For example if you a
merging a patch that was submitted to master you should decide if that
patch needs to be backported to stable/beryllium and/or stable/lithium as
well at that time, typically this decision is done by the committer who
reviews and merges the patch. The best way to do this is to use the
Cherry-pick button right inside Gerrit. Choose cherry-pick and enter the
branch you'd like to carry the patch over to, most of the time this should
work trivially. If you get an error then you'll need to do it manually via
git commandline as there is likely some merge conflicts you need to take
care of.

If you cherry-pick at time of merge it will save you a lot of effort of
porting patches to new branches as your code is kept in sync. Typically you
should cherry-pick bug fixes backwards to stable branches and only pull in
new features to master branch but that is up to your project.

Another thing I highly recommend all committers review and understand is
this blog post regarding how to write well formed commit messages.

http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

This is an excellently written blog post about the importance of writing
commit messages that are meaningful and useful. If you've never had to
troubleshoot and debug code you may not realize the usefulness but commit
messages are immensely useful when you are troubleshooting and trying to
find which patch introduced a regression in your code. If you need examples
of really well written commit message, the Linux Kernel project is one of
the best source of commit messages since they are extremely strict on only
accepting patches that have well formed commit messages.

Hope this helps,
Thanh

At the moment, we ask projects to report their ports on the wiki [1],
the test plan [2], and the milestone readout [3].  We could also add it
to the Per-Project Release Plan.  However, as we scale on the growing
number of projects, I wish we had some automatic mechanism to detect
potential port conflicts using something like static analysis at build
time or introspection at runtime.

I was actually suggesting also somewhere in the code this port info is
registered - beyond the wiki. BTW the wiki info is accurate for OpenFlow.

One way we could force an up-to-date port list from projects would
be to add it to the Per-Project Release Plan.

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Per-Project_Boron_Release_Plan_Template

We could (manually, for now) make sure that wiki/Ports is correct
and that there are no conflicts.

1) Do you want to participate in a hackfest?
Yes

2) If yes, when you would prefer (M3 is mid May, M4 is mid June as two
likely candidates)?
M4 (June)

Is there a rough plan on where the hackfest will be held so that we can
work on VISA issues?

Hello,

With patch? https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/36714/ (and several
preceding ones), the controller core (ie md-sal) now has support for
using OSGi blueprint for code wiring. The main motivation for this is
for better upgrade support and usability wrt to the config system (CSS).

The plan is to merge the above patch within the next few days. The
md-sal services are provided via blueprint (as OSGi services) and also
via the CSS. So apps will continue work as is using the CSS. The core
blueprint support enables apps to use blueprint for code wiring in lieu
of the CSS.

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Using_Blueprint outlines how to use
blueprint in ODL apps.

Once this patch is merged, if there are any issues, please respond to
this email.

Tom

    In order to help maintain a cleaner committer list, we would like to
    kindly ask that projects routinely review and update their committer

    the TSC [1] [2], we would like projects to:

    * Identify committers who have been inactive for more than 6 months
    * Reach out to them to understand if they would like to step down or
    if there are compelling reasons they would like to stay a committer
    despite their inactivity.
    * In the event of a non-response despite repeated attempts to
    contact the committer and/or the committer asks to step down from
    the role, have them removed as a committer and notify the TSC.
    * Ensure that everyone knows the TSC is willing to arbitrate any
    disputes and note that this process is intended to ensure the
    committer list better reflects reality rather than anything political.

    A more detailed description of the process can be found on the TSC
    Main Page [3].  Perhaps we can start tracking the progress of this

I think it is enough for your requirement. I'm not familiar with DLUX, so I
cannot give more suggestions. If you want to improve DLUX, you can contact
DLUX team to talk about more details. I believe they will be happy for your

Regarding your question about the missing data, I think it's best you
provide some information about your OpenDaylight version and a list of
installed featuresso we can try to reproduce the issue on our machine. 
Or maybe thecolleagues from the openflowplugin team can give some insight.

Regards,
Kai

I ran mininet with tree topo,3 . pingall worked.
When I check the http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes

flow-node-inventory:current-speed"": 0 , max speed  data is missing .

And I modified the L2switch-> loop remover code to get the shortest path ! .will it be the reason for data missing?

Help me out !  Thanks in advance .let me know if you want more details .

Karthik,

I have also cc'd this email to the DLUX and openflowplugin mailing lists.  Hope that helps.

Regarding your question about the missing data, I think it's best you provide some information about your OpenDaylight version and a list of installed features so we can try to reproduce the issue on our machine.  Or maybe the colleagues from the openflowplugin team can give some insight.

Regards,
Kai

I did not get the """"flow-node-inventory:current-speed"": 0,"" in my flow !. I simply launched ODL, installed openflowplugin ,mininet running .

Hi Karthik,

In current implementation, you can get rate of speed (both current speed and maximum speed) from opendaylight-inventory. After installing openflowplugin, you can send a GET request to the url <http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes> http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes to get a JSON format response.

The JSON response is like this schema:

~~~ json
{
  ""nodes"": {
    ""node"": [
      {
        ""id"": ""openflow:7"",
        ""node-connector"": [
          {
            ""id"": ""openflow:7:LOCAL"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:state"": {
              ""link-down"": false,
              ""blocked"": false,
              ""live"": false
            },
            ""flow-node-inventory:configuration"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:hardware-address"": ""6A:13:45:A1:4F:48"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:current-speed"": 0,
            ""flow-node-inventory:advertised-features"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:name"": ""n7"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:supported"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:current-feature"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:port-number"": ""LOCAL"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:maximum-speed"": 0,

Hi Team ,


 Myself karthik , working in ODL.I have a questions. Please help me!.


When I am giving iperf or ping between two hosts , I need to check the network speed (rate at which data is traveling) in each link.For example you could see the ONOS UI , It will show you the data speed in each link.


So I think In ODL DLUX-UI we dont have that kind of stuffs. I would like to develop that. I need your help. From where can i get the details of rate of speed? L2switch or OpenflowPlugin project or anything else? Give me some idea I will do it.


Thanks,

Hi Karthik,

Rate speed feature needs OpenFlow1.3. You can start your mininet with extra argument `--switch=ovs,protocols=OpenFlow13` to enable OpenFlow 1.3.

Hi kai ,

Thanks a lot for your reply .I'm using ODL- integration stable/ lithium .
I installed odl-l2switch-all , openflowplugin-all, restconf-all, dlux-all

I ran mininet with tree topo,3 . pingall worked.
When I check the http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes

flow-node-inventory:current-speed"": 0 , max speed  data is missing .

And I modified the L2switch-> loop remover code to get the shortest path ! .will it be the reason for data missing?

Help me out !  Thanks in advance .let me know if you want more details .

Karthik,

I have also cc'd this email to the DLUX and openflowplugin mailing lists.  Hope that helps.

Regarding your question about the missing data, I think it's best you provide some information about your OpenDaylight version and a list of installed features so we can try to reproduce the issue on our machine.  Or maybe the colleagues from the openflowplugin team can give some insight.

Regards,
Kai

** This mail has been sent from an external source **

Hi Karthik,

In current implementation, you can get rate of speed (both current speed and maximum speed) from opendaylight-inventory. After installing openflowplugin, you can send a GET request to the url <http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes> http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes to get a JSON format response.

The JSON response is like this schema:

~~~ json
{
  ""nodes"": {
    ""node"": [
      {
        ""id"": ""openflow:7"",
        ""node-connector"": [
          {
            ""id"": ""openflow:7:LOCAL"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:state"": {
              ""link-down"": false,
              ""blocked"": false,
              ""live"": false
            },
            ""flow-node-inventory:configuration"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:hardware-address"": ""6A:13:45:A1:4F:48"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:current-speed"": 0,
            ""flow-node-inventory:advertised-features"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:name"": ""n7"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:supported"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:current-feature"": """",
            ""flow-node-inventory:port-number"": ""LOCAL"",
            ""flow-node-inventory:maximum-speed"": 0,
            ""flow-node-inventory:peer-features"": """",
...
~~~

I think it is enough for your requirement. I'm not familiar with DLUX, so I cannot give more suggestions. If you want to improve DLUX, you can contact DLUX team to talk about more details. I believe they will be happy for your contribution. :)

Best,
Jensen

Hi Team ,


 Myself karthik , working in ODL.I have a questions. Please help me!.


When I am giving iperf or ping between two hosts , I need to check the network speed (rate at which data is traveling) in each link.For example you could see the ONOS UI , It will show you the data speed in each link.


So I think In ODL DLUX-UI we dont have that kind of stuffs. I would like to develop that. I need your help. From where can i get the details of rate of speed? L2switch or OpenflowPlugin project or anything else? Give me some idea I will do it.


Thanks,

the only available tools in CI are basic RHEL/CentOS linux images with
Java. You should note and ask for anything beyond that here. Email
helpdesk at opendaylight.org <mailto:helpdesk at opendaylight.org> [3] It is
recommended to use the OpenDaylight CI infrastructure unless there is
some HW or SW resource that cannot be installed there. Update the test

So I do not know what caused the growth, but looking at output of:

user at work : ~/odl/distribution/distribution-karaf on master $ mvn
dependency:tree

the distribution is one sorry mess, and it is not just one project. What
we can do are actually multiple things:

1) snmp4sdn can stop pulling in AD-SAL components from previous
releases, two versions of Spring Framework plus the entire pre-karaf
container

2) lispflowmapping would do some good if it did not pull jmock via its
unittest-tools

3) nemo could use a more modern version of netty than 3.2.6

4) alto and tsdr can agree on a common version of jetty

5) capwap can start using odl-netty instead of requiring netty-all

6) usc can stop pulling in akka-testkit

7) gbp can stop pulling in long-dead controller's third-party jersey

8) sfc could take a look if they really need jersey containers for their
sfc-vnfm-tracker

9) tsdr can try to not pull the 13MiB jruby-all for hbase client

These are relatively simple and would go a long way towards reducing the
distro.

Bye,
Robert

I'm getting errors of tool-1.7.0.jar not found. I'm stuck in this problem

My FYP is optimizing big data processing using SDN. I also want to know if
there are other ways to optimize big data processing through Opendaylight

need help in this.

One outcome of this IETF is that ALTO introduces the footprint and capability interface (fci) map, to support the CDNi use case. I feel that this is an important use case and hence may I request that we add this in the next release?
Thank you!

It may be worth checking whether the version of Jetty bundled with
Karaf is suitable (8.1.15.v20140411 as of Karaf 3.0.6, available as the
""jetty"" feature in the standard repository).

The following projects (as far as I know) have no documentation:
* eman
* honeycomb/vbd
* infrautils

The following projects (as far as I know) have no updates to their
documentation haven't let us know that none are expected:
* alto
* capwap
* centinel
* dlux
* groupbasedpolicy
* iotdm
* l2switch
* lacp
* netide
* of-config
* openflowplugin
* opflex
* packetcable
* snmp
* ttp
* yang-push

At the very least, I strongly recommend projects read over their current
docs to figure out if they make references to things like ""in the
Beryllium release"" that need to be update and/or refer to non-existent
or changed features.

Cheers,
--Colin

+1 Kai

0 Jensen

I hope for more contributions and more recent ones, but I see that
Jensen has been doing things like docs and reviewing code, which
are appropriate for committers.

-1 Shawn

I agree with Alexis, I expect a more extensive contribution history,
both more patches and more recent patches, from committers.

If ALTO is in dire need of more committers and think Shawn will start
doing lots of code review, I'd be glad to consider that info.

ALTO developers,


I think this mail from Daniel sums up the results. Both Jensen and Kai are not formally committers and you can send a mail to ""helpdesk at opendaylight.org"" <helpdesk at opendaylight.org> to get those powers granted. It seems like at least two TSC members felt like they'd rather wait on Shawn based on his current contributions.


I could keep pushing for more TSC members to vote?we're at 7 of 10?but my guess is that the feeling will be the same.



Cheers,

--Colin

Hi Kai,

Is there an ETA one when the tests can be fixed?

as it's blocking us from building the Carbon release.

Thanks,
Thanh

Hi Everyone,

Boron SR3 build #236 is complete and ready to test. Details on where to 
get the artifacts and testing documents are located here [1]. The 
tracking spreadsheet [2] has a new tab for the csit tests which we will 
update once the integration-distribution-test-boron job completes [3].

ALTO does have a lot of features which might make it easier to hang but 
I'm not sure how much it helps. Can we remove ALTO from the building

we can trim the features.

Perhaps it's not the best practice but I think it may be reasonable to

yeah exactly, you'll find the ""real"" reason there - what you saw here is
just a symptom.

PS: But what is a curious is the ""ClassNotFoundException:
org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException"" - that looks like some..
mismatch of Pax Exam front-end and back-end used, or something like that? I
would not have expected a ClassNotFoundException, even if the communication
with Karaf container fails. No time on my side to dig into this right now,
but if we see these ClassNotFoundException from SFT more often, we should
probably find out more about what's going on here... (but again, this is
NOT the reason for this failure).

Greetings folks,

A follow up on the upcoming Bugzilla to JIRA migration. I've had a few
folks send me mappings of their ODLID / bugzilla account to LFID and
Colin asked if there was a survey / form to fill out. Given that I think
that's an excellent idea I've created one [0].

Why are we asking for this information? If we don't then we don't have a
good way of making sure that issues in JIRA get properly assigned to
people as the issues come over from Bugzilla.

Secondly, this data will also help us when we do our Gerrit migration to
LFID as it will allow us to more efficiently unblock / remap accounts in
the system.

Our ask is you fill out this form before next week, October 19 as we are
presently planning on migrating Bugzilla to JIRA on the 20th. For the
very few of you that have already sent information in, if I could ask
that you go ahead and fill out the form as well it will make it a lot
easier to deal with instead of having to merge information from several
different emails.

-Andy-

Which stack trace?
Looking at surefire report [2],

It seems to me that the error is not directly related to the odl-alto-simpleecs feature. The stack trace seems to indicate that the error occurs when the test is already finished but collapses during the clean-up.

Unfortunately no ETA can be provided.

I was looking at the console log from the Jenkins page. A similar error

Could be. However, I would be curious to know why the errors happen on 
(different) ALTO features. Could be related to resources.

But the funny thing is that my Gerrit committer permission has some issue.

According to the alto committers group there are 3 committers currently,
Kai, Jingxuan, and Richard. So you should be able to merge your own patches. If
you're having account issues then please contact the helpdesk to get them
resolved.

Patchset 3 is currently failing verify so it needs to at least pass before
we can merge it. I've issued a recheck on patchset 3 and will merge it if
it passes but if it doesn't I will need someone to resolve the merge issue.

I'm not sure what to do about the failure:

Error downloading mvn:org.opendaylight.yangtools/yang-model-export/2.0.1

Seems like perhaps a missing dependency declaration somewhere so karaf is
not able to find the artifact. Anyone know what needs to be updated?

I followed the instructions on https://pymotw.com/2/socket/multicast.html <https://pymotw.com/2/socket/multicast.html> on how to make OpenDayLight controllers able to manage multicast flux. 
While following the procedure over Postman, I found the errors indicated on the bottom. The code used is the same proposed on the link.

You can try ""100.1.1.1/32"" instead.

Good luck!

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_OpenFlow_Plugin:End_to_End_Groups.
It looks like the previous set ups are okay (in the right directories) as well.
./karaf
sudo mn --custom topology.py --topo mytopo
--controller=remote,ip=192.168.56.101         xterm h1 h3 h5
Is there's something else for me to do? Otherwise, I'll have to look
for other alternatives (if any).
Have a great day.

Dario.

And from the YANG model [1], the value of this field should be an IP prefix.

I just tested this API with correct IP prefixes on OpenDaylight Carbon SR1.
It works. I think the related YANG model never changed since Boron release
or even earlier. So it should also work on Nitrogen and Oxygen. Not sure
which release you are using.

Add openflowplugin team and documentation team into this thread.

Hi OpenFlow Plugin team,

Can someone take a look at this issue? I think somebody should update the
document to fix this typo at least. Because the same typo also appears in
the user guide [2], which is a part of the release.

Best,

and takes ~10 seconds to compile/test on my laptop. I remember there were
quite a few such failures while compiling ALTO modules (and sometimes other
projects), but the compilation managed to go through at a certain point. I
don't think the transient failures can be mitigated very well by improving
a certain project.

One hypothesis is that this could be a JVM issue that it runs short of
resources during the compilation. But according to the log, there should
still be plenty of memory. Emm...

Since most failures happen during single feature tests, it would be one
direction to look into.

As for solutions, first I would think of something such as incremental
compilation or checkpoints. Maven has this ""-rf"" option to resume a
compilation. It may not be a good practice in production systems but I feel
it might make some sense in handling transient failures.

Another option might be executing the single feature tests after the
compilation. As the projects have their own jenkins jobs, they should be
less likely to raise compilation errors. Since a success build requires all
SFT to pass anyway, I think the order may be less critical.
[Don't know whether this is feasible, though :(]

Just my two cents.

Best,
Kai

Hello,

https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-143 is tracking this for
some time. Noone is working on it AFAICT.
