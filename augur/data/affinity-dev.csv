In case you do not know we have created a new project in OpenDaylight with the goal of coordinating release, integration and test efforts across all projects.

The project has already gathered a few people willing to collaborate, however as I stated on the last week Hackfest: we have a strong dependency on the other projects, this is we cannot do much without your support.

In particular we need a contact (at least one) person in your team who can:

1) Sign-up the vHackfest proposed by Ed (see below) so that we are sure we fulfill M3 Continuous Integration Test Start requirement. Note this is IMMEDIATE need (by tomorrow).
2) Answer general questions about test procedures and quality regarding your project
3) Provide a high-level overview of your deliverable features (especially those subject to test) so that we can have a consistent release and also better plan for the final tests

I hope I hear from you very soon

Thanks in advance
/Luis

I've put up a page for the vHackFest here:

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/HackFests:vHackFest_Sept_19_2013

Please make sure at least one person from each project signs up there
to participate in the vHackFest on Thursday no later than Mon Sept 16 so we can all meet the M3 Continuous Integration
Test Start requirement.

According to the Hydrogen Release Plan:

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2013

We should commence continuous integration testing no later than next week.

In order to facilitate that its been suggested we do a vHackfest next week to insure that each project:

1)  Has at least some integration testing running
2)  Has a Jenkins Job that kick off when a project it depends on changes

The basic thought is to kick off on IRC with Webex's available for screensharing/voice collaboration
over a 24 hours period (not expecting folks to stay up 24 hours... work your normal hours, but we are a
global team)  My initial thought was kicking off at

10am CEST (Rome, Brataslava) on Thu Sept 19 (aka 1am PST on Thur Sept 19)
end at
10am CEST Fri Sept 20 (aka 1am PST on Fri Sept 20)

How do those times work for folks?  Can I get at least one volunteer from each project?

Ed

How would folks feel about doing a vHackfest on Thursday Oct 17 covering

1)  Model and MD-SAL Integration
2)  Plugging into the OpenStack Neutron Service

That way Ryan can participate, and folks have time to prep?

Sound good?

So long as the Neutron Service part is between 1:00pm to 5:00pm US CDT, I'm fine.  My morning of 10/17 is already booked up.

How would folks feel about doing a vHackfest on Thursday Oct 17 covering minimally:

1)  Model and MD-SAL Integration
2)  Plugging into the OpenStack Neutron Service

That way Ryan can participate, and folks have time to prep?

Sound good?

For the vHackfest, I'd like to propose a topic around how we can test and
migrate to the MD-SAL without breaking the current code.

The naive approach of a single mega-update that introduces the MD-SAL, any
relevant adaptor bundles, and any other changes that need to be made to the
bundles above/below the SAL seems untenable. Based on some of the commits
I've been seeing, I'm not sure that the plan is to go the route of full
backward compatibility via adaptor bundles either.

I think a lot of us would be interested in discussing and better
understanding how we're going to move forward here given the far-reaching
ramifications of this shift.

Excellent topic. I'll put it on the TSC agenda for next week. We
should take it up on the TWS call as well.

Do any projects in the Virtualization Edition need sample bundles?
 - org.opendaylight.controller.samples.loadbalancer
 - org.opendaylight.controller.samples.sample-toaster
 - org.opendaylight.controller.samples.simpleforwarding

Is it ok to remove all sample bundles from the Virtualization Edition?

These bundles are just *sample* bundles,
and already included in the Base Edition.

Furthermore, VTN Manager does not correctly work,
if samples.loadbalancer or samples.simpleforwarding is running.
These bundles set flow entries to switches,
so it might break flow entries set by VTN Manager.

Therefore, if all bundles delivered by projects in the Virtualization Edition
does not need these bundles,
I would like to remove sample bundles from the Virtualization Edition.

Thanks,

git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/affinity is the git
repository and the current API is in

Examples in python scripts may be easier to follow -- those are in:
scripts/affinity.py and scripts/analytics.py.

 1) The northbound API was created back in August before the yangtools
commit. We're in the process of creating a new API based on yangtools. A
small sample of the new API can be seen with the path redirect affinity
(referred to as nfchain in the affinity repository).

 2) Yes, we use the flow programmer service (and use a priority = 3) for
affinity driven flow rules. Any other southbound protocol using the ""flow""
interface would be compatible in the future. We've only tested with mininet
which runs ovswitch.

Are there particular things you are looking to do with affinity. If so we'd
be glad to discuss.

Thank you for the answers!

I?ve checked AffinityNorthbound.java.

The current Affinity Metadata Service supports Affinity group and Affinity link.
We can create an Affinity link with one ?from? and one ?to? affinity group.
We can set a waypoint attribute to an affinity link.
We can associate hosts with an affinity group based on IP addresses.

Is my understanding correct?

Does the new API based on yangtools provide the same functionality as the current API?

Do you have a plan to provide other way to associate hosts with an affinity group
other than IP address base?


I tried to build Affinity Metadata Service,
but it failed.

When I executed the following mvn command,
  [odp-dev:~/work/affinity] $ mvn clean install
the mvn command output the following messages.

When someone runs run.sh and send some configuration to Affinity, OpenDOVE, or VTN,
the Virtualization Edition does something useful.
It requires some configuration, but it does something great related to virtualization.

I think it's the same with simpleforwarding bundle to require configuration.
Simpleforwarding bundle requires subnet gateway configuration to forward packets.
I mean that even the Virtualization Edition include simpleforwarding,
we need some configuration anyway.

My one concern on simpleforwarding bundle is that simpleforwarding sets flow entries automatically
after detecting host information.
It means that simpleforwarding ignore virtual network configuration on Affinity and VTN,
and may install flow entries which interfere with Affinity and VTN.

Therefore, I would like to remove simpleforwarding bundle from the Virtualization Edition.

Furthermore, I think simpleforwarding bundle doesn't do virtualization jobs,
but just simulates a traditional IP network.
So it is a little weird to me that the Virtualization Edition include simpleforwarding bundle.

To be honest, It's not clear to me that other project in the Virtualization Edtion needs simpleforwarding bundle,
or simpleforwarding bundle interfere with other bundles too.
So I would like to hear from other project people.

I have a more general question here (I cc controller dev): maybe I am missing something but why the simple forwarding application is always on in the controller (i.e. creating flows for all known hosts)? I see it is a very good use case but in my opinion it should have a turn on/off button, same as subnet gateway feature. It is not only for VTN, I am thinking on any app or consumer of the controller that may be interested in knowing the attached hosts without automatically creating flows for them.

Thanks/Luis

I support the idea of having apps and features doing something useful with very few (b) or no configuration (a). Only concern is for those that do not require configuration (a), at least make sure they have very low or none impact in the controller behavior or switches configuration. A good example is Topology Manager that without any configuration reads information from the switches and creates a topology with no impact in controller/switches. On the other side we have Simple Forwarding app that writes flows in the switches whenever the controller discovers a host, I think this is quite an impact for an app that runs out of the box. With this I do not mean to remove this feature or other features like this but move them to (b) -> enable them with simple configuration, what you are actually proposing.

On the other hand, I take the chance to encourage the projects to come up with a simple (first contact) demo case for their contributions and publish it in the wiki, same thing OVSDB folks have done today at TSC call:

any user-initiated configuration or policy tasks requiring flow rule
creation in the switches where such priority and conflicts can be evaluated
and resolved. I say user-initiated in contrast to flow rules from network
events -- arp, learning bridge, ...

VTN Manager is not also a client of the affinity service.
And, I don't know any clients of the affinity service in the Virtualization Edition.


In my environment, I did not send any configuration to the affinity service,
but the affinity service installed flow entries to switches when the controller received packets.

I'll check the behavior of the affinity service and VTN Manager in the Virtualization Edition again.

It seems to me that affinity.nfchainagent and affinity.implementation bundles depend on affinity.l2agent.
The affinity.l2agent runs as a learning switch like the one described in the following link.
  http://archive.openflow.org/wk/index.php/OpenDayLight_Tutorial#Sample_application:_MAC_Hub_or_Learning_Switch

The affinity.l2agent installs flow entries when it receives a packet and it knows the destination MAC address of the packet. 
So the affinity.l2agent allows communication between all hosts it detects.

  L2Agent.java
    https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=affinity.git;a=blob_plain;f=l2agent/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/affinity/l2agent/L2Agent.java;h=b3b285b415bb30fd732de8f6bbae8a645ca90817;hb=HEAD

Is my understanding right?


On the other hand, VTN Manager allows communication only between hosts which belong to the same virtual tenant.

Therefore, flow entries installed by affinity service and VTN Manager might be inconsistent.

For the second release, it's better to provide some kind of mechanism to select which approach to use for peaceful coexistence.

In the last hackfest (September 10), I heard that Madhu planned to add a functionality to Container Manager
which provides a way to select bundles to be copyed for a container to be created.
I think such an approach solves the problem.

Hideyuki Tai

 Virtualization Edition Guide for VTN Manager","Mon, 18 Nov 2013 09:41:12 -0500",suchi.raman at plexxi.com (Suchi Raman),<CAOYYZjoocAO9UYoKFLHcjMEmvg1S0BXJth2aRRrhv82KOGFePg@mail.gmail.com>,"Hideyuki is exactly right -- we added southbound actions for one example
affinity -- redirecting a path of flows through a function chain and set
openflow priority = 3 to give it higher priority above basic l2 forwarding.

Affinity is currently unaware of virtual network context (VTN or Dove vnet)
or for that matter virtual controller context (containers).

A few possibilities on how to move forward:

*(API service): *
 * affinities as being within a virtual network context. We'll need to add
a virtual context name or identifier to the API. I believe the NB api for
VTN and Dove have unique identifiers for this.

*(L2 service): *
 * Traffic redirection uses L2agent to perform mac rewrites - since there
is no default L2 implementation, adapting the demo L2agent from the
tutorial was a quick way to get going. L2agent is also a single tenant
implementation.

My understanding is that Dove and VTN only control edge OVS switches and do
not control L2 forwarding of the physical switches -- please correct me
here if this is incorrect. Or are we saying that VTN manager has its own
connectivity implementation and perhaps Dove has one too. If this is the
case using Hideyuki and Madhu's suggestion to select the correct L2 service
provider seems like the right thing. There is one method in particular used
for Mac re-writes -- not sure how easy this is to implement in the VTN or
Dove L2 service.


I think this integration is important for first release, so would
appreciate a quick resolution to this....

We don't do mac re-writes. The traffic redirection service in the affinity
repository used to implement the southbound data path for path redirect
affinity does not do mac re-writes. It consults the L2 service to do a MAC
address to output port lookup for the waypoint server's address and
proceeds to forward it toward the waypoint. The MAC addresses on the frame
remain unchanged.

multiple implementations also has implication on NB integrations with 
OpenStack, which I don't think we've figured out yet.

That said, it seems odd to me that affinity would be an issue -- my 
impression was that it provides a way to specify relationships -- and 
other services are essentially clients of the affinity service and pick up 
what the user has specified.     Is the nature of the incompatibility also 
documented somewhere (assuming we have some idea of what is breaking)? Are 
any of the virtualization services currently clients of the affinity

is really feasible for Hydrogen).

If affinity is just doing L2 redirection as an *example* to support such 
an affinity, shouldn't these rules be off by default? 

In other words, if affinity is a companion service for virtual networking, 
my view is that it should work within the context of the implementations 
providing the actual virtual network support.  In that case, your first 
suggested alternative would make the most sense IMO.

If you want to focus on the L2 service (your second option), then I'm not 
sure what the connection would be to virtual networking since as you said, 
this would be a single tenant example.

Regarding your questions:  DOVE does only control edge OVS switches, but 
VTN can (and does) program physical OF switches based on what I know about 
it.

And yes, both have their own connectivity implementation and would need to 
be integrated to use a third-party redirection such as the one Affinity is 
trying to do in this example.  But to be honest, I was expecting affinity 
to primarily provide a relationship database of sorts that other services 
could use to then implement those relationships on the network.  The 
redirection stuff seems to go way beyond this scope.

thanks.

 Virtualization Edition Guide for VTN Manager","Mon, 18 Nov 2013 20:30:10 -0500",suchi.raman at plexxi.com (Suchi Raman),<CAOYYZjpURM8Uux9DFLsjo0X4FK6VkggiWPE8-wcWLujz-ubHow@mail.gmail.com>,"Agreed -- we should proceed as discussed on the call today. To summarize
for those who didn't attend:

The traffic redirection service currently implemented by us is for
demo/test only and will be maintained as a separate service -- not required
as a dependency for affinity metadata service. The open question which we
may have to punt to next release is exactly how real L2/L3 connectivity
services (Dove, VTN) will interact with this metadata.

Also using the ""container"" as the tenant context seemed to be a reasonable
assumption for first release. How to map container to virtual network
context is up to the data path implementation.

 Virtualization Edition Guide for VTN Manager","Tue, 19 Nov 2013 02:23:26 +0000",h-tai at cd.jp.nec.com (Hideyuki Tai),<D25A78264D077A4780231A12F7B822C7551CA6@BPXM07GP.gisp.nec.co.jp>,"I totally agree with Anees.

I don't think more peaceful integration is really feasible for Hydrogen.

Actually, there are already severl ways to select services.
One way is to edit configuration file to filter bundles as I show in the wiki page.
Other way is to start/stop bundles on OSGi console after start up a controller.

Regarding Suchi questions:
Anees is right.
VTN Manager controls not only edge OVS switches,
but it controls edge/core physical/virtual OpenFlow switches.

Thanks,
Hideyuki Tai

I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and some days I wake up and
think that this multi-layered approach makes sense, but I think I've come
to believe that it's likely only right for dealing with things at the
absolute lowest levels.

Let me start off with a few things I think we can agree would be good:
1.) We really want policy to affect *all* rules in the network. This
includes the ""base"" routes. For instance, if policy says A and B shouldn't
be able to talk to each other, the ""base"" routes shouldn't violate that.
2.) We shouldn't require pair-wise awareness between apps for correct
composition. That is, an app writer shouldn't have to be aware of all other
apps to make them play nicely.
3.) We want to separate policy from mechanism, so we need some well-defined
notion of policy so that mechanisms can provide it.

I suspect that merely using priorities, i.e., layers, won't really get us
there. For one, we'd like the base routes to incorporate policy especially
if policy dictates something about route selection like traffic going from
A to B should only use 10 Gbps links or faster. Even without things like
that, these layered rules get pretty hairy. In the 2-layer version where
you only have base + exception, it's pretty clear that partially overriding
the base rules is probably fine, but in more complex scenarios, this breaks
down.

Imagine that you have a set of traffic engineering exception rules which
are routing elephant flows, but you also have a set of rules acting as a
network tap on a subset of the flows in the network. You don't want to let
the reroute avoid the tap. Ideally, you'd somehow make the tap dependent on
the reroute rule and thus get updated (synchronously) whenever a reroute
happens.

This hasn't even gotten into when rules actually conflict with each other
and whether/when you should merge the two rules vs. pick one.

This complexity is actually why I like the idea of using affinities as a
policy database. I had thought the right approach would look something like
this:
1.) Have the affinity service define a set of allowable policies, e.g.,
allow, deny, min-link-speed, waypoint, firewall.
2.) It then accepts these policies from other apps or users.
3.) Whatever is actually installing rules (what I had called
NotSoSimpleForwarding) supports all of the set of allowable polices and
reads them out of the affinity service.
4.) It then only installs rules that comply with the policies it gets from
the affinity service.

This enables us to build multiple different routing services which should
be able to differentiate themselves while still following policy but still
has a single entity responsible for these rules which eases some of the
pain of the multi-layer composition. It seems likely to me that a routing
service might only support a subset of the policies that can be expressed
and it should tell others about what policies it supports so that users and
apps know what they can and can't expect to work. I also think that a set
policies may become infeasible at some point and we need a way to raise
that error to users.

I still think to some extent you're going to want ways to manage how rules
collide, conflict, and merge in the network when you have two different
apps both trying to install rules, but my hope is that it can be the rare
case.

Sorry to jump in mid-dialog but I thought I would share some considerations.
I like the idea of considering Affinity for programming a controller common policy engine, but I would really want to keep the definition at that level.  In my opinion the policy function should be a component of the controller and be removed from the Affinity definition, I worry that if we align Affinity with Policy it becomes a rules programming interface and we end up exposing the realization rather than the wanted capability.  (Not saying you were heading that way in your thinking, just wanted to bring clarity at least on my opinion.  If my statement was even clear to anyone.)

Also reflecting on this:
Imagine that you have a set of traffic engineering exception rules which are routing elephant flows, but you also have a set of rules acting as a network tap on a subset of the flows in the network. You don't want to let the reroute avoid the tap. Ideally, you'd somehow make the tap dependent on the reroute rule and thus get updated (synchronously) whenever a reroute happens.
An elephant flow is usually like a freeway from one place to the other, you can get on and get off but there are no traffic lights on the way.  What I mean here is that I couldn't imagine trying to tap mid-flow I would usually direct my flow to a service or function that provides that capability.  If I re-route then I should still be aiming the elephant flow at that or an equivalent function in the network.
In my experience it is often better to provide simple constraints/assumptions on how we would expect the flows to be constructed/terminated and build from there.  If the base construct get's too complex it propagates the complexity into the policy machinery.

A couple of unsolicited cents from me.  :)

Regards,
Chris

While we may need a way to support multiple virtualization implementations 
simultaneously, this problem applies to the current VTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB 
projects and not the affinity project in my view.  Affinity metadata 
service should never conflict with any of these implementations, because 
it provides a database of user-specified affinities / policies, not an 
additional virtualization implementation -- i.e., it should not touch the

further.

We definitely need some thing to manage how rules collide, conflict, and
merge in the network.
In simple-forwarding network scenarios, the rules/policies can be easily
managed by users or rare-conflict forwarding modules.
However, in more complicated cases, e.g., many QoS scenarios, we should
have some module to help arrange, negotiate, and validate.
Priority is one preliminary way, but the management on it is also desired
to discuss.
Currently, there are several projects affecting the traffic forwarding in
non-simple logic, I think it's the timing to plan a whole.

43,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/,affinity-dev,message,[affinity-dev] [OpenDaylight Discuss] NotSoSimpleForwarding,"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 09:27:40 -0500",dlenrow at gmail.com (David Lenrow),<CAOJpQ-4CHx=dctK78R2vD+b8nivMPW+nYj_6jnMN5LuX0y7ZwQ@mail.gmail.com>,"We may need to start by choosing a model (or choosing to support more than
one ""mode"")

One approach (e.g. affinity) The default behavior  is traditional (L2
and/or L3) network. All exceptions live in policy plane.Here the goal is to
have best-effort connectivity as the baseline.

   - If I plug into the network I get basic connectivity
   - If the ""special"" stuff isn't behaving it's easy to roll back to
   traditional connectivity and forwarding.
   - Allows expected/default behavior for non-affinitized traffic. Policy
   only applied to special stuff.

An alternative approach (e.g. ACI) Everything needs policy to participate.
If you don't have a proactive policy pushed, you don't even get on the
network.

   - More secure against unknown devices getting on the net and
   probing/denying-service/hacking
   - Requires potentially large number of rules to describe all traffic,
   not just ""special"" stuff.


I would argue that the former approach allows large networks and numbers of
apps with existing limitations on table sizes, etc. and that the latter
assumes elements with ability to implement policy enforcement for orders of
magnitude more apps/flows.

Single writer and resolving conflicts suggests that a single policy layer
should be the answer. Priorities within this layer allow conflicts to be
identified and possibly resolved across the hierarchy of rules.

Regarding: ""Imagine that you have a set of traffic engineering exception
rules which are routing elephant flows, but you also have a set of rules
acting as a network tap on a subset of the flows in the network. You don't
want to let the reroute avoid the tap. Ideally, you'd somehow make the tap
dependent on the reroute rule and thus get updated (synchronously) whenever
a reroute happens.""

It is possible to insure that when one adds the reroute rule, he is made
aware that this conflicts with the TAP rule. At this point the entity
editing the policy could:
1) decide not to reroute
2) decide to reroute and knowingly break the Tap rule
3) Create a more complex policy that supports both the reroute and the TAP.

I don't see any way to determine automatically which conflicts are intended
and which should be denied. I think the best we can do is insure that the
editor makes changes with full knowledge of the impact on services. If all
of the policies live in a common, shared repository, it is at least
possible to insure that conflicts are not
created accidentally, without awareness.

Fort NOX has the ability to tell you when a new policy conflicts. It
assumes that such a conflict is an error. I think we need to detect these
conflicts, but allow some trusted application to create conflicts
intentionally.


If we start with a rule that A can't talk to B. And start to add a rule
saying that A reaches B using path X, it is clear at the policy layer that
these conflict. This is probably an error. If we start with A sends to B on
path X, and add a rule saying A to B has to go through virtual function F,
this is likely an intentional conflict to insert virtual middlebox
 processing. Deciding how to resolve this conflict is beyond the scope of
the policy language/DB, but such language should be sufficient to identify
any/all conflicts and provide context for smart client to differentiate
bugs from intentional over-ride.

Hope these comments are somewhat coherent. I need sleep.

I have to disagree with you on the need for the Affinity Service to touch the network. Yes, we do not need yet another virtualization implementation, but this is not about virtualization is about abstraction. As you may recall in the original Defense4All proposal we talked about the need to have controller services that provide an abstraction of the network and give higher level applications (L4-7, Security) the capability of monitoring and controlling the network without needing to fully understand the L2-3 topology.

The need for a network abstraction is orthogonal to network virtualization, our application for example works both in physical networks and in virtualized networks (in fact all the deployed PoCs we have up to now are physical), so it will be wrong in my opinion to look at something like affinity only in the context of virtual networks. Having said that, I do believe that when virtual network are deployed, affinity (or similar) should leverage the network virtualization service, i.e., in that case instead of touching the network directly it should ask the network virtulization to do it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the last TSC call where the issue of conflicting services in the virtualization edition was discussed further. 
But in reading Dave's notes, it seems there was some expectation that the current approach would need to be revisited: ""big piece of post-release work to do on finding the proper abstractions under which all three projects can complement each other"", referring to VTN/OpenDOVE/Affinity.

While we may need a way to support multiple virtualization implementations simultaneously, this problem applies to the current VTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB projects and not the affinity project in my view.  Affinity metadata service should never conflict with any of these implementations, because it provides a database of user-specified affinities / policies, not an additional virtualization implementation -- i.e., it should not touch the network (unless its scope is changing significantly).

If folks from these projects, have a different view, let's discuss it further.

Anees, 

I have to disagree with you on the need for the Affinity Service to touch the network. Yes, we do not need yet another virtualization implementation, but this is not about virtualization is about abstraction. As you may recall in the original Defense4All proposal we talked about the need to have controller services that provide an abstraction of the network and give higher level applications (L4-7, Security) the capability of monitoring and controlling the network without needing to fully understand the L2-3 topology. These is what at the time we called the ""Traffic Redirection"" and ""Statistics Collection"" services.   After presenting our requirements, we were told that these type of network abstraction services is exactly with Affinity is all about and after a few discussions with the Affinity team we agreed that with some minor changes (mainly syntactic) we can rely on Affinity to do the low level network control for us (the slide set that describes these changes can be found in the wiki at:  https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/File:Defense4All_Proposal_Overview_-_130903_-_Plexxi.pdf). 

The need for a network abstraction is orthogonal to network virtualization, our application for example works both in physical networks and in virtualized networks (in fact all the deployed PoCs we have up to now are physical), so it will be wrong in my opinion to look at something like affinity only in the context of virtual networks. Having said that, I do believe that when virtual network are deployed, affinity (or similar) should leverage the network virtualization service, i.e., in that case instead of touching the network directly it should ask the network virtulization to do it.

Subject: [OpenDaylight Discuss] Virtuailization addition and affinity service

Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the last TSC call where the issue of conflicting services in the virtualization edition was discussed further. 
But in reading Dave's notes, it seems there was some expectation that the current approach would need to be revisited: ""big piece of post-release work to do on finding the proper abstractions under which all three projects can complement each other"", referring to VTN/OpenDOVE/Affinity.

While we may need a way to support multiple virtualization implementations simultaneously, this problem applies to the current VTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB projects and not the affinity project in my view.  Affinity metadata service should never conflict with any of these implementations, because it provides a database of user-specified affinities / policies, not an additional virtualization implementation -- i.e., it should not touch the network (unless its scope is changing significantly).

If folks from these projects, have a different view, let's discuss it further.

thanks.

In that case I remove my disagreement, however from our point of view it is the affinity service that is providing the abstraction and the enforcement, whether affinity touches the network directly or thru a network virtualization layer  should  transparent  applications the network abstraction API (I.e. affinity in our case)

No disagreements with earlier discussions. Affinity abstraction is a high
level API that specifies the network path requirements (policy,
connectivity, ...) for a set of endpoints. Endpoints may correspond to an
application or represent some traffic. The affinity implementation will not
assume openflow on the southbound side.

As for enforcement -- who enforces what and when -- we will use
notifications from affinity manager, so that VTN/Dove may reprogram their
networks when configuration changes.

VTN is openflow-based and offers filtering and redirection services
natively within each ""virtual network"" (slice), so the data path for these
affinities -- path redirect and access control affinities -- for a
VTN-managed network is a direct translation. Translation with Dove may be
more involved. I think programming a mixed network (VTN + dove) has other
challenges as well that may need to be resolved centrally, but as you say
let's table this for later.

I totally agree with Anees.

I don't think more peaceful integration is really feasible for Hydrogen.

Actually, there are already severl ways to select services.
One way is to edit configuration file to filter bundles as I show in the wiki page.
Other way is to start/stop bundles on OSGi console after start up a controller.

Regarding Suchi questions:
Anees is right.
VTN Manager controls not only edge OVS switches,
but it controls edge/core physical/virtual OpenFlow switches.

Thanks,
Hideyuki Tai

Hi Luis,

Since affinity is not yet correctly integrated into VTN (nor Dove), you should exclude it during VTN/Dove system testing.

We will have this better integrated for next release.

Hi all,

Sorry to come back to this subject again but what is the final conclusion here? Do we really need to start/stop OSGi bundles in Virtualization edition or is it enough if we do not use 2 Virtualization apps simultaneously (having all the bundles up)?

Thanks/Luis

I totally agree with Anees.

I don't think more peaceful integration is really feasible for Hydrogen.

Actually, there are already severl ways to select services.
One way is to edit configuration file to filter bundles as I show in the wiki page.
Other way is to start/stop bundles on OSGi console after start up a controller.

Regarding Suchi questions:
Anees is right.
VTN Manager controls not only edge OVS switches,
but it controls edge/core physical/virtual OpenFlow switches.

Thanks,
Hideyuki Tai

Subject: [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info

Hi Kyle, OpenDove, VTN & OVSDB devs,

Since we all have integrations completed with the Neutron nb-apis and these southbound drivers (ovsdb, open-dove, vtn)
cannot co-exist in the same virtualization edition, I was thinking of extending the Neutron NB-API to include the information
on which Southbound driver to choose. By doing that, all of these bundles can co-exist in the same virtualization edition and
based on the Openstack/Neutron deployment, the customer can choose which ODL-southbound to use. This can be done along
with the existing configuration that is needed on the OpenStack to point to the ODL-Northbound API & the authentication details.
something like :

[[post-config|/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini]]
[ml2_odl]
url=http://192.168.56.1:8080/controller/nb/v2/neutron
username=admin
password=admin
southbound=[ovsdb | opendove | vtn]

We can ofcourse keep this configuration inside the OpenDaylight as well. But, having it done as part of Neutron provides a single
point of configuration and let the Neutron administrator decide on what is to be done, rather than depending on another administrator
who might handle the Opendaylight Controller.

Please share your opinion and I can get this thing done on the Opendaylight side.

Thanks,
Madhu

Madhu?s proposal focus on the co-existing problem between southbound drivers for Neutron Interface.
I explained about this problem in the following mail.
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/discuss/2013-November/000910.html
To solve this problem, I think Madhu?s proposal is good.

The co-existing problem between Affinity, VTN Manager, and simpleforwarding is a different problem.
In the Virtualization Edition, more than one application exist, and they try to control the same network resources simultaneously.
Because different applications have different policies on how to control network resources, it?s obvious that flow entries installed by different applications are inconsistent.
To solve this problem, we need other solution.

Subject: [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info

Hi Kyle, OpenDove, VTN & OVSDB devs,

Since we all have integrations completed with the Neutron nb-apis and these southbound drivers (ovsdb, open-dove, vtn)
cannot co-exist in the same virtualization edition, I was thinking of extending the Neutron NB-API to include the information
on which Southbound driver to choose. By doing that, all of these bundles can co-exist in the same virtualization edition and
based on the Openstack/Neutron deployment, the customer can choose which ODL-southbound to use. This can be done along
with the existing configuration that is needed on the OpenStack to point to the ODL-Northbound API & the authentication details.
something like :

[[post-config|/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini]]
[ml2_odl]
url=http://192.168.56.1:8080/controller/nb/v2/neutron
username=admin
password=admin
southbound=[ovsdb | opendove | vtn]

We can ofcourse keep this configuration inside the OpenDaylight as well. But, having it done as part of Neutron provides a single
point of configuration and let the Neutron administrator decide on what is to be done, rather than depending on another administrator
who might handle the Opendaylight Controller.

Please share your opinion and I can get this thing done on the Opendaylight side.

Thanks,
Madhu

Good questions.
I will not pretend to be an expert in this area as I have had little time to dig into these projects unfortunately.

My reaction/response is therefore one of practicality.

We are so close to the delivery date it feel unreasonable to integrate these functions for the Hydrogen release.
I suggest we aim at delivering option (a) in the 2014 release.  I would also support the Affinity API being exposed in the basic release in 2014 as I see value in a higher level API even in the base release, this would be very useful and interesting to expose to campus and lab environments enabling higher layer app development.

Regards,
Chris

1) Run all apps together but try to use only one virtualization at a time, for this we need:

- Virtualization apps do not take any action in the network (i.e. like writing flows) by default but after activating something through their NB API
- Virtualization apps do not share NB APIs, this includes the Neutron and so that Madhu proposal makes sense here

2) Enable (by configuration) one app at a time. In this case the above is not necessary for obvious reasons, however this looks more like a 3-4 Virtualization editions instead of only 1.

Anyway whatever is the implementation the result looks the same: For Hydrogen release we cannot use more than one Virtualization at a time, am I right?

Hi Suchi,

Good questions.
I will not pretend to be an expert in this area as I have had little time to dig into these projects unfortunately.

My reaction/response is therefore one of practicality.

We are so close to the delivery date it feel unreasonable to integrate these functions for the Hydrogen release.
I suggest we aim at delivering option (a) in the 2014 release.  I would also support the Affinity API being exposed in the basic release in 2014 as I see value in a higher level API even in the base release, this would be very useful and interesting to expose to campus and lab environments enabling higher layer app development.

Regards,
Chris

In addition to the basic metadata setting/getting, the affinity engine has a way to set forwarding rules for traffic redirection. This is the feature required for Radware.

We have a couple of options --

(a) Include affinity in the base edition for Hydrogen release, targeted for small scale testing and campus networks. Design integration between Dove/VTN/affinity and deliver for next release.

or

(b) Limit affinity to basic metadata setting/getting and leave it in the virtualization edition. Postpone Radware integration to next release. Design VTN/Dove affinity integration in next release.

Option (b) is easier and option (a) puts us in better position for next release. This is relatively minor in comparison to the Dove + VTN discussion which is also in this thread.

Comments welcome.

As we've discussed at some length, Affinity is not in the same category of
function as the virtualization implementations, and also doesn't implement
the Neutron APIs, so I don't think the issue of multiple Neutron API
clients applies to Affinity.

 Per Tai-san's note, we're addressing the issue of overlapping control of
the network by i) making the Affinity example flows default-off and
optional, and ii) providing configuration support so that the
virtualization edition runs a single implementation (i.e., one of
VTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB).   (unless something else was discussed in the TWS
call earlier today)

thanks.

	I don?t much like the notion of turning one and only one participant off by default in
an Edition.   Its possible we have to fall back to starting all off and having the user decide
which to enable? but just turning *one* off doesn?t feel right to me.

Subject: [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info

Hi Kyle, OpenDove, VTN & OVSDB devs,

Since we all have integrations completed with the Neutron nb-apis and these southbound drivers (ovsdb, open-dove, vtn)
cannot co-exist in the same virtualization edition, I was thinking of extending the Neutron NB-API to include the information
on which Southbound driver to choose. By doing that, all of these bundles can co-exist in the same virtualization edition and
based on the Openstack/Neutron deployment, the customer can choose which ODL-southbound to use. This can be done along
with the existing configuration that is needed on the OpenStack to point to the ODL-Northbound API & the authentication details.
something like :

[[post-config|/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini]]
[ml2_odl]
url=http://192.168.56.1:8080/controller/nb/v2/neutron
username=admin
password=admin
southbound=[ovsdb | opendove | vtn]

We can ofcourse keep this configuration inside the OpenDaylight as well. But, having it done as part of Neutron provides a single
point of configuration and let the Neutron administrator decide on what is to be done, rather than depending on another administrator
who might handle the Opendaylight Controller.

Please share your opinion and I can get this thing done on the Opendaylight side.

Thanks,
Madhu

Hi Ed,

Madhu?s proposal focus on the co-existing problem between southbound drivers for Neutron Interface.
I explained about this problem in the following mail.
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/discuss/2013-November/000910.html
To solve this problem, I think Madhu?s proposal is good.

The co-existing problem between Affinity, VTN Manager, and simpleforwarding is a different problem.
In the Virtualization Edition, more than one application exist, and they try to control the same network resources simultaneously.
Because different applications have different policies on how to control network resources, it?s obvious that flow entries installed by different applications are inconsistent.
To solve this problem, we need other solution.

Agreed? I was just calling attention to the fact that while I think Madhu has made an elegant proposal for the
Neutron side of this issue? we do need a better solution overall :)

In future if ODL hosts another virtualization solution then i believe
rather then re-configuring neutron service for this new solution, switching
at the controller level will be more convenient way to go about it.

Just my 2 cents,

Seems like we are converging on keeping this a ODL side configuration & 
am perfectly fine with that.
I kind of sensed this from Kyle on the IRC as well (though he hasnt 
responded to this email thread ;) ).

I will push the changes to the networkconfig.neutron soon.

Its my fault that I had not participated in the previous discussions on

It would be awesome if you can schedule this meeting sooner (and not

We can find a good solution which everyone is happy with. Am open

Subject: RE: [affinity-dev] [OpenDaylight Discuss] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info

So from what I understand from this and other previous conversations, it looks like there are 2 trends for the Virtualization edition:

1) Run all apps together but try to use only one virtualization at a time, for this we need:

- Virtualization apps do not take any action in the network (i.e. like writing flows) by default but after activating something through their NB API
- Virtualization apps do not share NB APIs, this includes the Neutron and so that Madhu proposal makes sense here

2) Enable (by configuration) one app at a time. In this case the above is not necessary for obvious reasons, however this looks more like a 3-4 Virtualization editions instead of only 1.

Anyway whatever is the implementation the result looks the same: For Hydrogen release we cannot use more than one Virtualization at a time, am I right?

Hi Suchi,

Good questions.
I will not pretend to be an expert in this area as I have had little time to dig into these projects unfortunately.

My reaction/response is therefore one of practicality.

We are so close to the delivery date it feel unreasonable to integrate these functions for the Hydrogen release.
I suggest we aim at delivering option (a) in the 2014 release.  I would also support the Affinity API being exposed in the basic release in 2014 as I see value in a higher level API even in the base release, this would be very useful and interesting to expose to campus and lab environments enabling higher layer app development.

Regards,
Chris

In addition to the basic metadata setting/getting, the affinity engine has a way to set forwarding rules for traffic redirection. This is the feature required for Radware.

We have a couple of options --

(a) Include affinity in the base edition for Hydrogen release, targeted for small scale testing and campus networks. Design integration between Dove/VTN/affinity and deliver for next release.

or

(b) Limit affinity to basic metadata setting/getting and leave it in the virtualization edition. Postpone Radware integration to next release. Design VTN/Dove affinity integration in next release.

Option (b) is easier and option (a) puts us in better position for next release. This is relatively minor in comparison to the Dove + VTN discussion which is also in this thread.

Comments welcome.

As we've discussed at some length, Affinity is not in the same category of
function as the virtualization implementations, and also doesn't implement
the Neutron APIs, so I don't think the issue of multiple Neutron API
clients applies to Affinity.

 Per Tai-san's note, we're addressing the issue of overlapping control of
the network by i) making the Affinity example flows default-off and
optional, and ii) providing configuration support so that the
virtualization edition runs a single implementation (i.e., one of
VTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB).   (unless something else was discussed in the TWS
call earlier today)

thanks.

We are upgrading the jackson library from the old 1.9.8 to the newer

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/3905/
The NB Integration tests passed in the controller project.
This upgrade is required to bring in third-party library consistency

in the TSC call.

The changes are pretty much transparent unless some of the Jackson's 
json annotations are used.
I noticed that few of the projects outside the controller uses these 
annotations and depends on the
Controller's Northbound layer. Hence these projects must also upgrade 
from 1.9.8 to 2.3.0.

Alissa & I will take care of these upgrades as well. This is a heads up 
to all the devs in the relevant
projects to expect code-review requests from us.

It's not exactly same as you proposed in the code change, but based on.
We will use new library to communicate with controller and previous  library for our internal REST server.

72,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/,affinity-dev,message,[affinity-dev] Release Readiness : Dependency convergence,"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 16:57:41 -0800",mavenugo at gmail.com (Madhu Venguopal),<52D48B85.7080902@gmail.com>,"Hi Devs,

Sorry about this lengthy email. Please spend a couple of minutes to go 
through this. This is EXTREMELY important for the release.

As discussed during the TSC and the feverish work being done to get to 
the Release Readiness, we are tracking all the activities using :
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoSzir1BfjyWdDQyVElWNG9mcWxhblREckZjbjFxUVE#gid=1

This email is to take care of following 2 high priority items under 
""Global Code Cleanup"" :
- "" Identify all places dependency versions in project pom.xml files are 
not current for all ODL Dependencies""
- "" Update dependency versions in all pom.xml files to current SNAPSHOT 
version for all ODL Dependencies""

We have a jenkins job that is running on the controller project : 
*https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-version-changes/configure*
The ""versions"" plugin in this job will take care most of the work. It 
will find the LATEST dependency and also automatically submit a gerrit 
changes.
How cool is that !!! ? : (*Example Gerrit submission : 
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/4149/*)

Based on our investigation, we have a simple Action Item for each of the 
project owners in each project :

*All you have to do as a project owner is to copy the above jenkins 
configuration into your own project and do the necessary modifications 
based**
**on your project build needs. The most important maven option of 
interest :   (-B versions:use-latest-versions -DallowSnapshots=true).**
**Also observe the execute shell commands which you would need for auto 
gerrit review.*

The goal is to bring down the dependency errors 
(*https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console*) 
to zero
and let the integration project build to succeed.

Thanks,
Madhu


For the curious ones - more details :

I pushed the Dependency-Convergence enforcer changes to integration 
branch earlier today :http://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/4189
and this identifies all the dependencies that are not converged. We also 
have a jenkins job enabled in the integration project that will
run daily once to keep track of these failures :
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/

Failures seen in the first run :
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console

Please look for ""Dependency convergence error"" text in the above console 
log and this will give the hint on what are the failures that are 
currently active
in each of the bundle. The goal is to bring this to 0 failures.

Apologies on the long email again. I cant think of any better way to 
communicate this kind of info.
This email is also updated in wiki 
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:ReleaseRecommendations.

The last step of the development process for the Hydrogen (or any 
subsequent release) is to move from SNAPSHOT
versions of the bundle to the release version. This release version of 
the bundles are deemed the stable version.

As per the collective decision during the TSC call, we decided on 
starting the process of cutting over from SNAPSHOT
to the release version on 01/27 & we expect this process to be complete 
by 01/28.

*If this is the last step and if it is planned on 01/27, why are we 
discussing about this now ?**.**
**The answer is simple, There are lots of pre-work to be done here and 
the project owners (& volunteers) should gear up well in advance.**
*
This email will provide the recommendation for cutting-over to the 
release versions and the subsequent branching strategy.
This is a heavy topic and we have a ton of information to share and discuss.

*Short list of Things TODO for Project Owners and Project Volunteers to 
start working on today (01/14/2014)*

0. Finish up the ""Release Readiness : Dependency convergence"" ASAP.
(https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:DependencyConvergence)

1. Please review this email from Giovanni Meo : 
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-August/001042.html
     Most of it holds even for today. Some info are outdated (but still 
quite useful to know).

2. Prepare your project for the release (refer to 
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/978/).
     1a. Every POM file should have proper <scm> section. Care must be 
taken to make sure every pom file in a project must carry the exact 
<scm> section.
     1b. Add maven-release-plugin to the plugin management section of 
your project (refer to opendaylight/commons/opendaylight/pom.xml in the 
above gerrit : 978).
     1c. If not already present, add a POM file to the root of your 
project from where we can execute the release operations.

3. We will be using maven-release-plugin. Hence please review : 
http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html

4. Thank god, we have Giovanni amongst us :-), he already went through 
the painful process of releasing artifacts from the controller project and
      the jenkins jobs used for that (in September'2013) are as follows :
      4a. Prepare-only : 
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release-prepare-only/configure.
      4b. Final Publish : 
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release/
      Please review these & ask any questions you might have. Dont copy 
it yet to your projects.

5. Based on the Dependency tree evaluation, the only incorrect project 
dependencies was identified on controller depending directly on bgpcep.
     We have to remove this dependency from the controller project.

6. It is recommended to start with the 1.0.0 as the release/branch 
version. If we agree on 1.0.0 as the release/branch name, then the 
version of the
     parent root pom must be set to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, which will be 
automatically used by the jenkins job.


*List of things ToDo on 01/27**& 01/28*

0. Though the following activities are per-project related, it is 
recommended to do this as a group with representatives from all the 
projects present.

1. Based on the dependency tree evaluation, we have to perform the 
release process in the following sequence
     - yangtools
     - controller
     - openflowjava , ovsdb, opendove, vtn, affinity, bgpcep, 
lispflowmapping, snmp4sdn, defense4all (all these projects can be done 
in parallel)
     - openflowplugin (after openflowjava).

2. Any inter-project SNAPSHOT version dependencies must be changed to 
the RELEASE version dependency. For example, Controller project is
     dependent on Yangtools SNAPSHOT, it must be changed to the 
yangtools's release version & so on and so forth and commit the changes 
to your repo.

3. In each project, we have to copy both the Prepare-only & 
Final-Publish jenkins jobs from the controller project & adjust it to 
per-project configurations.

4. Execute the prepare-only jenkins job and make sure all the issues are 
resolved and we get to a successful execution.

5. Execute the Final-publish job (bulk-release) on your project that 
will publish the artifact to the nexus repo.

6. In Step4, the maven-release-plugin would also drop a tag in the GIT 
repo to mark the exact release point. We can either manually create a 
branch on
     each of the project with a Branch version (please note that this 
Branch version is Nothing to do with the artifact versions, as they are 
different in each bundle)
     or automate the branch creation on the jenkins job.

Ofcourse, there are tons of detailed information available on all these. 
Please dont take this lightly. Tons of stuffs to do in getting
the release out & hence your attention to this is highly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Madhu

A couple of quick clarification on future changes

- Soon after the RELEASE version, we would also have the subsequent 
SNAPSHOT version - I understand that release-plugin provides that 
discipline - but would we be following the same or there are any changes 
in ODL process-policy ?

- Would we be avoiding version changes in SNAPSHOT phase in future - the 
implication in mail-chain here - 
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-December/002312.html 

  Again, unmistakably, Giovanni provided a mechanism to streamline this 
:-) 

  But, would we have a policy that during SNAPSHOT phase we do not change 
module versions in future ? 
  Because version-changes during SNAPSHOT phase could help binary 
dependency flexibility (eg. not all modules could pickup latest versions 
of their dependencies) but from source-control perspective version-changes 
do not help.

I forgot to mention in the email that, this recommendation is purely for 
the Hydrogen release & we will deal with the
details on branch management and versioning post-hydrogen release. There 
is a huge implication on having multiple
versions of bundle floating around and we need much more stricter 
recommendations on how to handle such scenarios.
But, since for the Hydrogen release, we are converging on a release 
bundle, this issue can be postponed for Post-Hydrogen.

To answer your question :
1. Yes. the maven-release-plugin will automatically bump up the SNAPSHOT 
version from
<major>.<minor>.<micro>-SNAPSHOT  to <major>.<minor>.<micro+1>-SNAPSHOT.

2. Regarding the version changes post-hydrogen and dependencies, I would 
like to defer the discussion on a different email thread
     and not mix with the Release Readiness & i hope you are okay with that.

There is certainly a bigger implication on the bundle versions, 
SNAPSHOT, STABLE releases and their dependency trees.
A lot of discussion have to go inside that to have a stabler subsequent 
Helium release.

Thanks,
-Madhu

76,Pipermail,https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/,affinity-dev,message,"[affinity-dev] List of Files that have no Copyright/License
	information","Tue, 14 Jan 2014 15:50:28 -0700",probb at linuxfoundation.org (Phil Robb),<CAFHD1sOKWBoGSJhhVNDJbZucKJv0_X9PYQT4L70VtzbmXD3aHA@mail.gmail.com>,"Hi Suchi:

The attached file contains a list of filenames within your git repo that
have been identified as *not* having a License/Copyright header.

That is not to say that you *should* put a copyright/license header on each
of these files.  Some of the files are for third-party components.  *Clearly,
you should not change or insert your copyright statement on a file that you
or your organization did not author*.

I*n general, you should provide a copyright/license header in all files
within your repository for which you, or your organization are the author*.
 If you look at it from the user's point of view, due to the copyright
laws, the user is unable to copy or distribute any copyrightable work
without express written permission by the author.  If you do not provide a
copyright/license header, then the user has no rights to take your file
from the repository and work with it.  They instead would have to *assume*
that, since the project is identified as licensed under the EPL1.0 and/or
other files within the directory structure are licensed under the EPL1.0,
then this file is *probably* licensed under the EPL1.0 as well.  Making the
user assume that they are probably OK to use a file should be avoided if
possible.

Also, as you recall, we all sign off on the Developer Certificate of
 Origin (DCO) each time we commit anything to the repository.  The DCO
relies on there being a license declaration within each file and refers to
it stating:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or...

So, in order for the above clause to be true in the DCO, the license header
needs to be present in each file.

Finally, there are some files that are not copyrightable, and what is, and
is not copyrightable depends on a myriad of factors including jurisdiction,
file contents, etc..  Instead of trying to decide if a file is
copyrightable or not, we suggest that you include a copyright/license
header on all files that you own and which you want a user to be able to
work with when they take it from the repository.  If a file turns out to
not be copyrightable by the law, you have still provided valuable
information regarding your intent for your downstream users.

Thanks for your help with this.  If you have any questions, please post
them to the Discuss list.  We'll get them answered there so that everyone
can learn from it.

Phil.

Please add -Pintegrationtests to your versions jenkins job if your 
project also relies on IT (& re-execute the jenkins job).
We forgot to add it to the controller project before & I added it yesterday.
refer : 
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-version-changes/configure

Please feel free to edit this document once a project has changed states :

Current status :

1. Affinity, defense4all projects are in red (not started yet)
2. controller, lisp, openflowplugin, snmp4sdn in yellow (to fix / merge 
gerrit request).
3. openflowjava, ovsdb, opendove, bgpcep, vtn, yangtools in green.

Release & Branching recommendations



Hi Muthu,

I forgot to mention in the email that, this recommendation is purely for 
the Hydrogen release & we will deal with the 
details on branch management and versioning post-hydrogen release. There 
is a huge implication on having multiple
versions of bundle floating around and we need much more stricter 
recommendations on how to handle such scenarios.
But, since for the Hydrogen release, we are converging on a release 
bundle, this issue can be postponed for Post-Hydrogen.

To answer your question :
1. Yes. the maven-release-plugin will automatically bump up the SNAPSHOT 
version from 
<major>.<minor>.<micro>-SNAPSHOT  to <major>.<minor>.<micro+1>-SNAPSHOT.

2. Regarding the version changes post-hydrogen and dependencies, I would 
like to defer the discussion on a different email thread
    and not mix with the Release Readiness & i hope you are okay with 
that.

There is certainly a bigger implication on the bundle versions, SNAPSHOT, 
STABLE releases and their dependency trees.
A lot of discussion have to go inside that to have a stabler subsequent 
Helium release.

Thanks,
-Madhu

Hi Madhu, 

A couple of quick clarification on future changes 

- Soon after the RELEASE version, we would also have the subsequent 
SNAPSHOT version - I understand that release-plugin provides that 
discipline - but would we be following the same or there are any changes 
in ODL process-policy ? 

- Would we be avoiding version changes in SNAPSHOT phase in future - the 
implication in mail-chain here - 
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-December/002312.html 

  Again, unmistakably, Giovanni provided a mechanism to streamline this 
:-)   

  But, would we have a policy that during SNAPSHOT phase we do not change 
module versions in future ? 
  Because version-changes during SNAPSHOT phase could help binary 
dependency flexibility (eg. not all modules could pickup latest versions 
of their dependencies) but from source-control perspective version-changes 
do not help.

Sent by:        controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org 



Hi Devs,

Apologies on the long email again. I cant think of any better way to 
communicate this kind of info. 
This email is also updated in wiki 
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:ReleaseRecommendations
.

The last step of the development process for the Hydrogen (or any 
subsequent release) is to move from SNAPSHOT
versions of the bundle to the release version. This release version of the 
bundles are deemed the stable version.

As per the collective decision during the TSC call, we decided on starting 
the process of cutting over from SNAPSHOT
to the release version on 01/27 & we expect this process to be complete by 
01/28.

If this is the last step and if it is planned on 01/27, why are we 
discussing about this now ?.
The answer is simple, There are lots of pre-work to be done here and the 
project owners (& volunteers) should gear up well in advance.

This email will provide the recommendation for cutting-over to the release 
versions and the subsequent branching strategy.
This is a heavy topic and we have a ton of information to share and 
discuss.

Short list of Things TODO for Project Owners and Project Volunteers to 
start working on today (01/14/2014)

0. Finish up the ""Release Readiness : Dependency convergence"" ASAP.
    (
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:DependencyConvergence
)

1. Please review this email from Giovanni Meo : 
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-August/001042.html

    Most of it holds even for today. Some info are outdated (but still 
quite useful to know).

2. Prepare your project for the release (refer to 
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/978/).
    1a. Every POM file should have proper <scm> section. Care must be 
taken to make sure every pom file in a project must carry the exact <scm> 
section.
    1b. Add maven-release-plugin to the plugin management section of your 
project (refer to opendaylight/commons/opendaylight/pom.xml in the above 
gerrit : 978).
    1c. If not already present, add a POM file to the root of your project 
from where we can execute the release operations.

3. We will be using maven-release-plugin. Hence please review : 
http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html

4. Thank god, we have Giovanni amongst us :-), he already went through the 
painful process of releasing artifacts from the controller project and 
     the jenkins jobs used for that (in September'2013) are as follows :
     4a. Prepare-only : 
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release-prepare-only/configure
.
     4b. Final Publish : 
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release/
     Please review these & ask any questions you might have. Dont copy it 
yet to your projects.

5. Based on the Dependency tree evaluation, the only incorrect project 
dependencies was identified on controller depending directly on bgpcep.
    We have to remove this dependency from the controller project.

6. It is recommended to start with the 1.0.0 as the release/branch 
version. If we agree on 1.0.0 as the release/branch name, then the version 
of the 
    parent root pom must be set to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, which will be 
automatically used by the jenkins job.


List of things ToDo on 01/27 & 01/28

0. Though the following activities are per-project related, it is 
recommended to do this as a group with representatives from all the 
projects present.

1. Based on the dependency tree evaluation, we have to perform the release 
process in the following sequence 
    - yangtools
    - controller
    - openflowjava , ovsdb, opendove, vtn, affinity, bgpcep, 
lispflowmapping, snmp4sdn, defense4all (all these projects can be done in 
parallel)
    - openflowplugin (after openflowjava).

2. Any inter-project SNAPSHOT version dependencies must be changed to the 
RELEASE version dependency. For example, Controller project is
    dependent on Yangtools SNAPSHOT, it must be changed to the yangtools's 
release version & so on and so forth and commit the changes to your repo.

3. In each project, we have to copy both the Prepare-only & Final-Publish 
jenkins jobs from the controller project & adjust it to per-project 
configurations.

4. Execute the prepare-only jenkins job and make sure all the issues are 
resolved and we get to a successful execution.

5. Execute the Final-publish job (bulk-release) on your project that will 
publish the artifact to the nexus repo.

6. In Step4, the maven-release-plugin would also drop a tag in the GIT 
repo to mark the exact release point. We can either manually create a 
branch on
    each of the project with a Branch version (please note that this 
Branch version is Nothing to do with the artifact versions, as they are 
different in each bundle)
    or automate the branch creation on the jenkins job.

Ofcourse, there are tons of detailed information available on all these. 
Please dont take this lightly. Tons of stuffs to do in getting
the release out & hence your attention to this is highly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Madhu_______________________________________________

Subject: [controller-dev] Test with new OF13

Hi all,

There is a project related task before the release which is to verify the new OF plugin option (-of13) on those projects/applications that use OF. So the question is: have you already done any test? and if not when do you plan to do it?

We (Integration team) will be doing some testing by the end of the week but it is very advisable projects do their own tests as well.

Thanks/Luis

I have another question regarding pushing flows with OF13 plugin: From the end user perspective, is RESTCONF the only way to push flows with OF13 features or can we use FRM or any other application in the controller? My understanding is FRM works for OF13 switches but maybe it cannot deal with OF13 features...

I am now investigating the functionality of affinity project. Since the hydrogen had been released few days ago, what I tried was:

1. download the hydrogen jar package from the website of opendaylight.
2. download the affinity project from git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/affinity
3. build up the affinity project and also copy the necessary bundles into plugins folder of hydrogen, just followed the guide written in scripts/osgi.txt
4. follow the demo guide on wiki: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Affinity_Metadata_Service

But after I start the controller as well as mininet, and press the enter key of demo.py, there are some error messages pop up:

Subnet 10.0.0.254/8 added
[Press enter when mininet is ready]    
-------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

    self.output_port = data['actions'][0]['port']['id']
KeyError: 'port'

I opened the json file returned by opendaylight NB and figured out that the problem occurred because the parsing mechanism in analytics.py assumes the first element of 'actions' will always be a port information, however the json data returned by opendaylight NB was not in the form of that.

Is this because the demo file was written too early and not be able to support the NB format for now, or I just didn't do things right? If the problem occurred because the version of demo file was too old, will there be a new version that able to work with hydrogen? Where can I get the release version of affinity project? 

Thx for reply!

make it easier to run this demo.

However, the best way to pick up this change is to update the affinity tree
(assuming you have this) and rebuild the integration tree (for the
controller build). Do you have a copy of the integration tree checked out
and are you able to build this? If you need instructions on how to build
the integration tree, let me know.

If you do not use the integration build the correct set of bundles will not
be available -- for example, there are two forwarding services (simple
forwarding and l2agent) and we use l2agent. This is all packaged nicely
through the integration build which is the right way to start the
controller and affinity bundles.

Actually I don't really understand what do you mean by ""Intergration tree"". I downloaded the source code of affinity project through git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/affinity, so I guess I may not have a copy of that. Can you explain more about integration tree for me? Please tell me where to download the integration tree and also how to build it, and I will really appreciate that!

In addition, where did you upload your changes? Are there also a website that I can get the ""release"" version of affinity, instead of downloading it from git?

Finally, the python scripts I used was packaged in the source codes I downloaded from git clone, so I don't know whether my scripts version is deprecated or not. But I do figured out one strange thing about script files. I found a function in affinity_control.py, which named ""enable_waypoint"". This function tries to call the affinity northbound that sends a http PUT request in the form of ""link/{link_name}/enable"". However, I didn't find any northbound API in affinity northbound which included a command substring called ""enable"", so I am wondering if my affinity project version and scripts verison just didn't match.

Thx for reply!

Best Regards,
Yu-Chieh

??: Re: [affinity-dev] Problems when running demo.py

The issue is that the stats structure that analytics.py fetches via OpenFlow is only populated after the flows have been activated.

The exact sequence is important:
 (1) Start controller.
 (2) Launch demo.py (but pause at prompt)
 (3) Start mininet, confirm that topology is correct in GUI.
 (4) Issue pingall so that hosts can be registered in host DB.
 (5) Launch traffic so that large flows are started.
 (6) Press enter in the demo.py detection script.

We're looking to make this more automated by making the detector continuous.

One more thing I just forgot to mention about, I had loaded the ""l2agent"" bundle into opendaylight plugins/ folder from the very beginning, and it looks just working fine. But I don't know which function of forwarding (l2agent/simpleforwarding) that the demo used.

There are specific bundles that affinity configuration must exclude.

If your main goal is to use affinity (vs. develop code within affinity
project), I would recommend these steps:
(I have just updated this wiki, so please have a look).
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Affinity_Metadata_Service:Release_Review#Installation

It shows how to fetch the integration tree and use the run.sh scripts
within it. Please make sure you are always pulling the latest integration
repo since there have been bugs in it recently.

(The developer documentation is more complicated and I would not recommend
doing that initially).

You should not need to use individual bundles, just use the run.sh in the
virtualization edition of the integration tree. In my earlier email I sent
you a link to the wiki which will take you through the steps required for
this.

Let me know if this works...

Thx for your detailed wiki guide, it finally works! = D

I run the demo with the virtualization edition of ODL, and now I can see the demo result (I had downloaded the latest version of demo scripts). So the problem was that some bundles should be excluded! And also I didn't add flatl2 bundle to my base edition at the very beginning, I guess that's why I couldn't make it work before.

Yes, my goal is to understand how to use affinity as a tool to help me develop high level apps, and also to know the working mechanism of affinity by tracing code. Now I still have questions about the ""enable_waypoint"" mechanism, which I couldn't find any northbound format in affinity northbound that able to catch a PUT request forms as ""http://localhost:8080/affinity/nb/v2/affinity/default/link/{link_name}/enable"". Could you please tell me what I missed when tracing the code of affinity project?

Thx for your help!

Hi Yu-Chieh,

There are specific bundles that affinity configuration must exclude.

If your main goal is to use affinity (vs. develop code within affinity project), I would recommend these steps:
(I have just updated this wiki, so please have a look).
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Affinity_Metadata_Service:Release_Review#Installation

It shows how to fetch the integration tree and use the run.sh scripts within it. Please make sure you are always pulling the latest integration repo since there have been bugs in it recently.

(The developer documentation is more complicated and I would not recommend doing that initially).

We have started
using the enableaffinity command on the entire network (implemented in
flatl2.northbound). It would be useful extension to have a per-link enable,
though it has not been implemented today.

Good to hear you have demo.py working!

Hi Suchi, in normal situation, controller discovers hosts (host tracker) and then it pushes automatic flows for the discovered hosts, in your case you say you have the flows but you do not see the hosts?

I am using the virtualization edition of Opendaylight, and I got few questions about the affinity project.

1. I see the configuration written in the file ""run.sh"" excludes several bundles while executing affinity bundles (vtn, opendove, ovsdb, controller.samples). However, when the config is set to ""ovsdb"" or ""opendove"", they did not exclude affinity bundles. Also, I saw one line on the wiki: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Affinity_Metadata_Service:Release_Review#Installation
Under the title ""Architectural Issues"" it writes: ""Implementation of specific affinities on non-openflow networks (OVSDB, VTN, opendove)."", which I think the affinity project is going to integrate with the 3 mentioned bundles. So, why is it necessary to exclude those bundles when executing affinity project? Why is it not necessary to exclude affinity bundles while executing other configuration? 

2. Is affinity project capable under different configuration such as ""ovsdb"" or ""opendove""? I have tried to run demo.py under the setup of ""ovsdb"", and it failed just as I expected. Also, I didn't see it exclude the bundles under ""controller.samples"", so I expect the affinity project won't work under the other configuration. But why don't those configurations just exclude the affinity bundles?

3. Why is it necessary to exclude the bundles under ""controller.samples""? Is there no way to make them exist at the same time?

Thx for reply!

Yu-Chieh

I learned the basic concept of Affinity project from wiki: 
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Affinity/Developer_Guide
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Affinity_Metadata_Service

It says the affinity can provide (defined in Affinity Attribute):

1) latency sensitive (hop count sensitive)
2) bandwidth sensitive
3) isolated path
4) set_tap, deny/permit, redirect
5) priority forwarding

However, as I can see for now, only set_tap, deny/permit and redirect functions have been implemented in the bundle ""flatl2"". Will those additional functionality be implemented in the future?

Thx for reply!

I am planning to add the low latency and maxTput path implementation in
this release (also known as Helium).

It turned out that the problems we were seeing were due to a HW_PATH rule

I have read the description from the following website: http://ethancbanks.com/2014/02/05/what-opendaylights-hydrogen-release-means-for-network-engineers/

""Affinity for ODL is the open implementation of Plexxi?s traffic prioritization algorithm that works across any sort of fabric, not just a Plexxi optical fabric.""

I remembered that one function of Affinity described on wiki is that it can mark the traffic priority from 1 to 5, and then transmit the packets according to the flow priority. (link: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Release/Hydrogen/Affinity/Developer_Guide)

However, I didn't see any implementation in the affinity project so far. Will it be implemented to the project in the future, or there is already an existing solution implemented by Plexxi, and the affinity project just need to couple with it?

Thx for reply!

Best Regards,
Yu-Chieh

Is the affinity project just reached its goal and finished, or it may be stopped developing? Because I didn't see any affinity release plan in Helium Edition, also the code I just downloaded from affinity repository was almost the same as the code three months ago. However, the project ""group based policy"" is in Helium release plan, which seems to use some functionality from affinity.

you run the pings in the background, and run tcpdump on h2, you'll see h2

The pinging didnot stopped and the flow didnot redirected to h2.

 applications from controller into ofplugin repo","Wed, 7 Jan 2015 16:09:24 +0000",mirehak at cisco.com (Michal Rehak -X (mirehak - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco)),<7A0E76B44F85D94BBBAB47F2E58E9B8D0BCC1E21@xmb-aln-x11.cisco.com>,"Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.


There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.


Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

Very good question. I will let the experts answer but my understanding is protocol agnostic Network Services (Inventory, Topology, Statistics, FRM, Packet handlers, etc?) will be out of the controller project either in its own project (there is already a new project to build a multilevel topology) or in an existing one (as you mention we already talked about placing the Packet handlers in the l2switch project).

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate
openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin
repository.

Migration will take following steps:
* copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
* change project and package names where necessary (without changing model
content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
* 
* adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline:
16.01.2015)
* 
* remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:
* model/model-flow-base
* model/model-flow-service
* model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate
* statistics-manager
* forwardingrules-manager
* inventory-manager
* topology-lldp-discovery
* topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)
* aaa 
* l2switch 
* ovsdb 
* openflowplugin 
* affinity 
* packetcable 
* grupbasedpolicy
If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to
respond. 

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are
openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And
controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no
direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore
result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with
models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Michal

I am a bit worried about ""protocol-agnostic"" bit, as even if you factor the control protocol out, you have to make assumptions about your model of the world (contrast OF vs. PCEP vs. SR). Generic applications can work only as long as those assumptions hold.

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ""flow"", at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline. Realistically, its functionality is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of the underlying protocol (we have fully-integrated equivalents in PCEP and NETCONF, and they work better). With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).

Robert

Subject: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.

idea that some of what we were calling ""Network Service Functions"" end up
getting migrated to being inside a specific plugin does feel wrong.

As long as the parts that can be kept OF-independent can still be consumed
and reimplemented by others, I guess it's fine to move them from the
controller to the OpenFlow plugin project, but it does feel off.

As long as the parts that can be kept OF-independent can still be consumed

controller to the OpenFlow plugin project, but it does feel off.

there was already discussion about renaming those apps so we do not block some good general name (like NSF).
And yes - we might later come up with some more general modeling here which would be shareable by multiple protocols or at least apps. And then we would definitely play with the idea of pulling those models up to separate project so that controller models will stay protocol agnostic.

Now Abhijit got this idea regarding where is the best place to move OF-specific apps:
Those apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch. Are there any dependencies of those apps pointing on l2switch services?

Michal

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ?flow?, at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline.

Hi,

If there was a discussion on this topic in the community I missed it. I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.

Some of these make complete sense to me. For example, All the Openflow related models and OpenFlow specific components like Statistics Manager, and LLDP Discovery certainly belong in the Openflow Plugin project.

However, I think the following  Applications need to be more generic and protocol agnostic although the we only had an Openflow implementation until now.   Or, Are we talking about splitting the functionality of these into Generic Components which implement the Models and the NB Interface and Openflow Specific implementations?

  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-manager
Another reason I am bringing it up here is that there was a discussion thread of making L2 Switch project to be the home for generic services like Topology and LLDP Discovery  and potentially renaming it to be more generic to reflect the true nature of its content.

BTW, Does the list below represent the complete  picture of migrations like this or is there more? This might be a good topic for the TWS Call as well.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

?Raghu

Subject: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

in the OF-plugin, it should be housed in such a way that it tries as best
it can to avoid being any more OpenFlow-specific than it already is. Also,
it should be amenable to other plugins providing the backing functionality.

For example, it should be possible and easy for somebody else to provide
statistics and topology information to the relevant manager.

alluded to about my thought regarding the OF-specific apps: it is possible
for some one to use the OF-plugin but not use the L2 switch. So it should
not be mandatory for them to need to include the L2 switch. By OF-specific
apps (just so no one is confused) - Michal means what many people call NSFs:


   - statistics-manager
   - forwardingrules-manager
   - inventory-manager
   - topology-lldp-discovery
   - topology-manager

So I think these should be either in the controller, OF-plugin or a
separate new place (but not L2 switch).

I see interesting conversation here on the services being separated from Openflow.
Thought my experience may add some value to this discussion.
I was new to ODL and checked stub, SNMP4SDN and OpenFlow plugins and wrote a new custom plugin for a circuit switch where I reused the following services -
?  forwardingrules-manager
?  inventory-manager
?  topology-manager
I could use topology and inventory manager very well. I just used few parameters (which are relevant to our flows) for flows addition and deletion in forwardingrules-manager.
I could not use statistics manager service as the statistics are specific to packet switches and hence added a new REST API in this for circuit statistics.
I could not represent some properties for the nodeConnector but compromised them for an immediate solution.
Basically I tried reducing my work and hence reused the existing services.
So, I could make it work just by writing  a new southbound plugin without touching the services and the northbound.

It may be better to have the inventory and topology manager services available for any southbound plugin and not specific to openflow. Also, may be useful to make these more generic.
Also, Good to have the forwardingrules-manager services to be generic. So, one can add ACLs or Circuit connections or any other forwarding using this service.

Just my thoughts.
Correct me if I am wrong in any of the above.

Thanks,
Aneesha

I agree that L2 switch is not a logical home for  generic network services as long as the project is called L2 Switch.  But,the name aside, That was exactly the proposed charter of the project.

""This proposal is to separate out the Layer 2 specific handling code into a separate project and also create several reusable services. Following are some of the generic services we intend to create.?

 At the end of the day it does not matter too much where the code belongs. With the right Karaf feature names and dependencies user will be able to find it.  It is just that, One would not think to look at Open Flow Plugin for generic network services.  For some of these services, I can understand the model being the only thing common/generic and each southbound plugin potentially supplying its own implementation. Still, I think there would be some services which are common, protocol independent network services and we need a good home for those.

Thanks,

?Raghu

+1 to what Abhijit says above, but I'll add the caveat that if it ends up in the OF-plugin, it should be housed in such a way that it tries as best it can to avoid being any more OpenFlow-specific than it already is. Also, it should be amenable to other plugins providing the backing functionality.
For example, it should be possible and easy for somebody else to provide statistics and topology information to the relevant manager.

Hi Colin,
there was already discussion about renaming those apps so we do not block some good general name (like NSF).
And yes - we might later come up with some more general modeling here which would be shareable by multiple protocols or at least apps. And then we would definitely play with the idea of pulling those models up to separate project so that controller models will stay protocol agnostic.

Now Abhijit got this idea regarding where is the best place to move OF-specific apps:
Those apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch. Are there any dependencies of those apps pointing on l2switch services?

On the one hand, I agree that the FRM is currently very OF-oriented, the idea that some of what we were calling ""Network Service Functions"" end up getting migrated to being inside a specific plugin does feel wrong.

As long as the parts that can be kept OF-independent can still be consumed and reimplemented by others, I guess it's fine to move them from the controller to the OpenFlow plugin project, but it does feel off.

Hello Raghu,

I am a bit worried about ?protocol-agnostic? bit, as even if you factor the control protocol out, you have to make assumptions about your model of the world (contrast OF vs. PCEP vs. SR). Generic applications can work only as long as those assumptions hold.

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ?flow?, at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline. Realistically, its functionality is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of the underlying protocol (we have fully-integrated equivalents in PCEP and NETCONF, and they work better). With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).

Bye,
Robert

Subject: Re: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Hi,

If there was a discussion on this topic in the community I missed it. I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.

Some of these make complete sense to me. For example, All the Openflow related models and OpenFlow specific components like Statistics Manager, and LLDP Discovery certainly belong in the Openflow Plugin project.

However, I think the following  Applications need to be more generic and protocol agnostic although the we only had an Openflow implementation until now.   Or, Are we talking about splitting the functionality of these into Generic Components which implement the Models and the NB Interface and Openflow Specific implementations?

  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-manager
Another reason I am bringing it up here is that there was a discussion thread of making L2 Switch project to be the home for generic services like Topology and LLDP Discovery  and potentially renaming it to be more generic to reflect the true nature of its content.

BTW, Does the list below represent the complete  picture of migrations like this or is there more? This might be a good topic for the TWS Call as well.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

?Raghu

Subject: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

Few questions wanted to confirm with you:

1. Are you planning to upstream your custom plugin for circuit switching to OpenDaylight?
      Our Plugin does not really cover all the features of the Circuit Switch Specification. It has the functionality which is required for our switch. Does this partial implementation really add value if we upstream (and also using AD-SAL)?
2. Are you using the MD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation (plugin & FRM) or are you using the AD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation (the OpenFlow 1.0 protocol plugin, FRM, etc.)?
        We decided to go with Hydrogen Release and AD-SAL as Helium was still not released. We used the ?Extensions to the OpenFlow Protocol in support of Circuit Switching? (Addendum to OpenFlow Protocol Specification (v1.0) ? Circuit Switch Addendum v0.3). We would like to move to MD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation but with the current priority work items, it may take some time to do this. We still have no time frame for that.
3. Can you elaborate the rough design that you are using the FRM? Will be great if you can share an architecture diagram.
       The design is same as the Openflow protocol. I am sharing the user guide to get an idea on how I am using the FRM.

Hi All,

I see interesting conversation here on the services being separated from Openflow.
Thought my experience may add some value to this discussion.
I was new to ODL and checked stub, SNMP4SDN and OpenFlow plugins and wrote a new custom plugin for a circuit switch where I reused the following services -
?  forwardingrules-manager
?  inventory-manager
?  topology-manager
I could use topology and inventory manager very well. I just used few parameters (which are relevant to our flows) for flows addition and deletion in forwardingrules-manager.
I could not use statistics manager service as the statistics are specific to packet switches and hence added a new REST API in this for circuit statistics.
I could not represent some properties for the nodeConnector but compromised them for an immediate solution.
Basically I tried reducing my work and hence reused the existing services.
So, I could make it work just by writing  a new southbound plugin without touching the services and the northbound.

It may be better to have the inventory and topology manager services available for any southbound plugin and not specific to openflow. Also, may be useful to make these more generic.
Also, Good to have the forwardingrules-manager services to be generic. So, one can add ACLs or Circuit connections or any other forwarding using this service.

Just my thoughts.
Correct me if I am wrong in any of the above.

Thanks,
Aneesha

I agree that L2 switch is not a logical home for  generic network services as long as the project is called L2 Switch.  But,the name aside, That was exactly the proposed charter of the project.

""This proposal is to separate out the Layer 2 specific handling code into a separate project and also create several reusable services. Following are some of the generic services we intend to create.?

 At the end of the day it does not matter too much where the code belongs. With the right Karaf feature names and dependencies user will be able to find it.  It is just that, One would not think to look at Open Flow Plugin for generic network services.  For some of these services, I can understand the model being the only thing common/generic and each southbound plugin potentially supplying its own implementation. Still, I think there would be some services which are common, protocol independent network services and we need a good home for those.

Thanks,

+1 to what Abhijit says above, but I'll add the caveat that if it ends up in the OF-plugin, it should be housed in such a way that it tries as best it can to avoid being any more OpenFlow-specific than it already is. Also, it should be amenable to other plugins providing the backing functionality.
For example, it should be possible and easy for somebody else to provide statistics and topology information to the relevant manager.

To expand on what Michal alluded to about my thought regarding the OF-specific apps: it is possible for some one to use the OF-plugin but not use the L2 switch. So it should not be mandatory for them to need to include the L2 switch. By OF-specific apps (just so no one is confused) - Michal means what many people call NSFs:

?  statistics-manager
?  forwardingrules-manager
?  inventory-manager
?  topology-lldp-discovery
?  topology-manager
So I think these should be either in the controller, OF-plugin or a separate new place (but not L2 switch).

Hi Colin,

And yes - we might later come up with some more general modeling here which would be shareable by multiple protocols or at least apps. And then we would definitely play with the idea of pulling those models up to separate project so that controller models will stay protocol agnostic.

Now Abhijit got this idea regarding where is the best place to move OF-specific apps:
Those apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch. Are there any dependencies of those apps pointing on l2switch services?

Subject: Re: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

On the one hand, I agree that the FRM is currently very OF-oriented, the idea that some of what we were calling ""Network Service Functions"" end up getting migrated to being inside a specific plugin does feel wrong.

As long as the parts that can be kept OF-independent can still be consumed and reimplemented by others, I guess it's fine to move them from the controller to the OpenFlow plugin project, but it does feel off.

Hello Raghu,

I am a bit worried about ?protocol-agnostic? bit, as even if you factor the control protocol out, you have to make assumptions about your model of the world (contrast OF vs. PCEP vs. SR). Generic applications can work only as long as those assumptions hold.

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ?flow?, at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline. Realistically, its functionality is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of the underlying protocol (we have fully-integrated equivalents in PCEP and NETCONF, and they work better). With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).

Bye,

Subject: Re: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Hi,

If there was a discussion on this topic in the community I missed it. I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.

Some of these make complete sense to me. For example, All the Openflow related models and OpenFlow specific components like Statistics Manager, and LLDP Discovery certainly belong in the Openflow Plugin project.

However, I think the following  Applications need to be more generic and protocol agnostic although the we only had an Openflow implementation until now.   Or, Are we talking about splitting the functionality of these into Generic Components which implement the Models and the NB Interface and Openflow Specific implementations?

  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-manager
Another reason I am bringing it up here is that there was a discussion thread of making L2 Switch project to be the home for generic services like Topology and LLDP Discovery  and potentially renaming it to be more generic to reflect the true nature of its content.

BTW, Does the list below represent the complete  picture of migrations like this or is there more? This might be a good topic for the TWS Call as well.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

?Raghu

Subject: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

2. You are using only a very small subset of the flow actions compared to
what the OpenFlow 1.3 FRM supports
3. If you move to MD-SAL - you should be able to still change the OpenFlow
1.3 MD-SAL based FRM  for your private consumption even if its location is
the OpenFlow plugin project (instead of the controller). Also if and when
you migrate your custom plugin to MD-SAL as well as open source it -
perhaps you can help out in abstracting out the parts of the OpenFlow 1.3
MD-SAL based FRM which are not OpenFlow specific (and can be reused by your
plugin).
4. Your plugin is using the ?Extensions to the OpenFlow Protocol in support
of Circuit Switching? (Addendum toOpenFlow Protocol Specification (v1.0) ?
Circuit Switch Addendum v0.3). Technically its at least partially OpenFlow.

here is the update of goals and deadlines:

With Amit from l2switch we came to agreement that all NSF apps will be moved to openflowplugin. And we might later change mind and move it elsewhere but for now in order not to increase current delay we want proceed.

Here are shifted deadlines for migration steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Subject: [openflowplugin-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.


There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.


Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

I just pushed the migration proposal patch to affinity:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/14572/

There are 2 changes you need in order to have this working:
    controller https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/14464/
    ofplugin https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/14463/

This two changes should be merged in next few days.
Then it will be necessary to merge proposed patch (14572)

I tested it locally:
- applied patch 14464 to controller
- applied patch 14463 to openflowplugin
- built affinity with JUnit tests

because you do not have any karaf distribution for starting I couldn't do other tests.

So please judge whether your project will be running after this applying this patch

Migration details (we are a bit off the schedule):
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/openflowplugin-dev/2015-January/002386.html

P.S.
I also added some commiters to be 100 % sure that someone from affinity-dev will read.

Thank you,
Jozef

Greetings,
here is the update of goals and deadlines:

With Amit from l2switch we came to agreement that all NSF apps will be moved to openflowplugin. And we might later change mind and move it elsewhere but for now in order not to increase current delay we want proceed.

Here are shifted deadlines for migration steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 23.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 30.01.2015)

Regards,
Michal

Subject: [openflowplugin-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.


There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.


Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

Why is affinity in the list? this project was not in Helium and will not be in Lithium.

Subject: Re: [release] [openflowplugin-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
here is the update of goals and deadlines:

With Amit from l2switch we came to agreement that all NSF apps will be moved to openflowplugin. And we might later change mind and move it elsewhere but for now in order not to increase current delay we want proceed.

Here are shifted deadlines for migration steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline:16.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 23.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 30.01.2015)

Regards,
Michal

Subject: [openflowplugin-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline:09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.
The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.
With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.

There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.

Thank you.
Regards,
Michal

I do not why we keep on showing not active projects in the ODL project list wiki [1], if we cannot remove them at least a note saying ""not active or not available this release"". This is not only confusing external people but confusing ourselves. I heard something about retiring old projects in past TSC call but I will bring the topic again next call.

You'll note that I've commented out the lines for affinity and

1. Does your project have any plans to be archived?  If your project has no plans for any future active development, project committers can vote to move a project to the Archived State by a Termination Review according to the OpenDaylight Project Lifecycle and Releases document [1].
2. If you projects plans to remain active, does it intend to participate in the Boron Simultaneous Release as documented in the Boron Release Plan [2]?  If not, could someone please publicly decline to participate with a message like so: ""The <PROJECT_NAME> project is formally declining to participate in the Boron SR"".

The last project related activity on Gerrit is Apr 28, 2014.

committers that might have plans to do something with it at some point in
future. I personally have no issues with archiving this project, and would
like to see any future related work rolled into one of the other ODL
projects that addresses this scope (e.g. NIC). Mat at Plexxi, CC'ed, might
be able to provide a corporate perspective on whether Plexxi has future dev
plans in ODL affinity.

merged commit [1] on 5/1/2015?over two years ago. In general, we try to the
set of projects in OpenDaylight mostly up-to-date.

As the currently listed committers, would you have any issue with the
project being archived at this point?

If not, we can create an Archive Proposal [2] and then after two weeks of
public comment period either have you vote or the TSC vote to have it
archived.

Thanks,

archive the Affinity project. Full details of the reasons for archiving it
can be found on the archive proposal here:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Archive_Proposals/Affinity_Metadata_Service

I've added the vote to formally archive it to the TSC agenda for the 6/9/16
meeting two weeks from today.
