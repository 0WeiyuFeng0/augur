GHData aims to provide an interface to data related to GitHub repositories. This project requires the GHTorrent database. [Backups of this database are avaliable](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html) and [it can be synchronized with current data](https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghtorrent-sync). Support for all event types reported by the [GitHub Events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/) are planned for the version 1.0.0 milestone.

GHData is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!

Dependencies
------------

- Python 3.4.x

Optional:
- MySQL 5.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)

Python libraries:
- All Python dependencies are handled automatically by `pip`.


Installation
------------

### Step 1 - Download and install

[Grab the source tarball for the latest release](https://github.com/xxx) and use `pip` to install
it as a package. Replace `0.x.x` with the latest release version number.

We recommend doing this inside a Python [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), but it
is not a requirement. If you are not inside a virtualenv you may have to run `pip` as root (not recommended!).

    $ tar xf 0.x.x.tar.gz
    $ pip install ./GHData.x.x

Then run the install script for the default system:

    $ ./GHData.x.x/scripts/install-ghdata.sh

### Step 2 (Optional) - Change the default configuration

Not required, but strongly recommended, is to generate an initial config file:


### Step 3 (Optional) - Add MySQL configuration


### Step 4 - Database setup

Finally, to create all necessary tables and views in the database:

    $ ghdata dbinit

You only need to do this once. **This command will drop all existing tables from your GHData database, so be careful!**
