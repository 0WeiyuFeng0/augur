GHData is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting the GHData project requires a copy of the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html).

GHData is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!



Roadmap
-------
Our technical, outreach, and academic goals [roadmap](https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/wiki/Release-Schedule).



Installation with Docker
------------------------
  1. Clone the repo
  2. `docker-compose build`
  3. `docker-compose up`


Installation without Docker
---------------------------
### Dependencies
- Python 3.4.x/Python 2.7.x and `pip`
- Static web server such as nginx or Apache
- MySQL 5.x or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/)
  - You can use the [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for testing
- [Installation instructions](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/tree/master/sql)

After restoring GHTorrent (or msr14) to MySQL, it is recommended you create a user for GHData. GHData only needs `SELECT` privileges.

Once the database is set up, clone GHData
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/
cd ghdata && pip install -U .
```
Copy the files in [ghdata repo]/frontend/public to your webserver:
```bash

Run `ghdata` to create the configuration file (ghdata.cfg). Edit the file to reflect your database credentials.

Run `ghdata` to start the backend. Visit your front


Developer Installation
----------------------

### Dependencies
- Python 3.4.x and Python 2.7.x with `pip2` and `pip3`
- MySQL 5.x or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/)
  - You can use the [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for testing
- NodeJS 7.x or newer

First, clone the repo and checkout the dev branch:
 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/ && git checkout dev
    ```

If you are updating the documentation or the frontend, you'll need to
install the node packages `apidoc` and `brunch` globally and install the
frontend's dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install -g apidoc brunch
    cd ghdata/static/ && npm install
    ```

In one shell, you'll want to run `ghdata`, in another run `cd frontend/ && brunch watch -s`
