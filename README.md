GHData is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting the GHData project requires a copy of the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html).

GHData is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!



Roadmap
-------
Our technical, outreach, and academic goals [roadmap](https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/wiki/Release-Schedule).



Installation with Docker
------------------------
  1. Clone the repo
  2. `docker-compose build`
  3. `docker-compose up`



Installation without Docker
---------------------------
### Dependencies
- Python 3.4.x and `pip`
- MySQL 5.x or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/)
  - You can use the [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for testing
- [Installation instructions](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/tree/master/sql)

After restoring GHTorrent (or msr14) to MySQL, it is recommended you create a user for GHData. GHData only needs `SELECT` privileges.

Once the database is set up, clone GHData (`git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/` then install `cd ghdata && pip install -U .`

Run `ghdata` to create the configuration file (ghdata.cfg). Edit the file to reflect your database credentials.

Move ./ghdata/ghdata/static/ to a static host on the same domain. If you would like GHData to serve the files itself, set the "developer" flag to 1 in ghdata.cfg. *`ghdata` must be run in the base of the repo if it is serving the static files*

Run `ghdata` to start the backend.
