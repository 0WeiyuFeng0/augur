GHData aims to provide an interface to data related to GitHub repositories. This project requires the GHTorrent database. [Backups of this database are avaliable](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html) and [it can be synchronized with current data](https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghtorrent-sync). Support for all event types reported by the [GitHub Events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/) are planned for the version 1.0.0 milestone.

GHData is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!

Dependencies
------------

- Python 3.4.x

Optional:
- MySQL 5.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)

Python libraries:
- All Python dependencies are handled automatically by `pip`.


Installation
------------

### Step 1 - Download and install

[Grab the source tarball for the latest release](https://github.com/xxx) and use `pip` to install
it as a package. Replace `0.x.x` with the latest release version number.

We recommend doing this inside a Python [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), but it
is not a requirement. If you are not inside a virtualenv you may have to run `pip` as root (not recommended!).

    $ tar xf 0.x.x.tar.gz
    $ pip install ./DoSOCSv2-0.x.x

Then run the install script for the default system:

    $ ./GHData.x.x/scripts/install-ghdata.sh

### Step 2 (Optional) - Change the default configuration

Not required, but strongly recommended, is to generate an initial config file:


### Step 3 (Optional) - Add MySQL configuration


### Step 4 - Database setup

Finally, to create all necessary tables and views in the database:

    $ dosocs2 dbinit

You only need to do this once. **This command will drop all
existing tables from your SPDX database, so be careful!**

Usage
-----

The simplest use case is scanning a package, generating a
document, and printing an SPDX document in one shot:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package.tar.gz: package_id: 1
    dosocs2: running nomos on package 1
    dosocs2: package.tar.gz: document_id: 1
    [... document output here ...]

Also works on directories:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot ./path/to/directory

The scan results and other collected metadata are saved in the database
so that subsequent document generations will be much faster.

To just scan a package and store its information in the database:

    $ dosocs2 scan package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package_tar_gz: package_id: 456
    dosocs2: running nomos on package 456

In the default configuration, if a scanner is not specified, only `nomos`
is run by default. It gathers license information, but is a bit slow.
One can use the `-s` option to explicitly specify which scanners to run:

    $ dosocs2 scan -s nomos_deep,dummy package.tar.gz
    dosocs2: package_tar_gz: package_id: 456
    dosocs2: running nomos_deep on package 456
    dosocs2: running dummy on package 456

After `dosocs2 scan`, no SPDX document has yet been created.
To create one in the database (specifying the package ID):

    $ dosocs2 generate 456
    dosocs2: (package_id 456): document_id: 123

Then, to compile and output the document in tag-value format:

    $ dosocs2 print 123
    [... document output here ...]

Use `dosocs2 --help` to get the full help text. The `doc` directory
here also provides more detailed information about how `dosocs2` works
and how to use it.

Potential Organizational Use of dosocs2

History
-------

dosocs2 owes its name and concept to the
[DoSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) tool created by Zac
McFarland, which in turn was spun off from the [do_spdx](https://github.com/ttgurney/yocto-spdx/blob/master/src/spdx.bbclass) plugin for Yocto
Project, created by Jake Cloyd and Liang Cao.

dosocs2 aims to fill the same role as DoSOCS, but with support for SPDX 2.x, a
larger feature set, and a more modular implementation, among other changes.
